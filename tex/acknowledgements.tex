\blackout{Without doubt, the three years of my PhD were an amazing time.}

\blackout{For that, I first want to thank my adviser Tilman Plehn:
for taking me on as a student, for working with me on intriguing
questions, and for disagreeing with me on countless questions over
coffee. I want to express my sincere gratitude to him for always
having my back, including coming into the office on a Sunday morning
to get me a backup laptop when mine broke down days before a
deadline. And last but certainly not least, I am grateful to him for
clearing the way to an academic career for me, even though I finally
decided against this path.}

% I would like to thank Bj\"orn Malte Sch\"afer for reading and
% refereeing this thesis, and Monica Dunford and Susanne Westhoff for
% completing my examination committee. Further praise is reserved until
% after the defence.

\blackout{The Research Training Group ``Particle physics at the LHC'' (DFG GRK
1940) paid my salary and, together with the Heidelberg Graduate School
of Fundamental Physics, my travels. I am grateful for their support.}

% During the different PhD projects, I had the great pleasure to
% collaborate with a number of amazing scientists. Together with Tilman
% Plehn, Ayres Freitas and David L\'opez-Val saw me off to a great
% start. Anke Biek\"otter joined us a little later. Chasing the diboson
% ambulance with JoAnne Hewett, Joachim Kopp, Tom Rizzo, and Jamie
% Tattersall was a wild and fun ride. One of the best ideas during my
% PhD was to invite Kyle Cranmer to a beer in Caf\'e Botanik. Working
% with him was truly inspiring, and was even more fun when Felix Kling
% joined our team.  Heartfelt thanks to all of my collaborators.

% Much of the work presented in this thesis would not have been possible
% without the help from others. In particular I would like to express my
% gratitude to Juan Gonzalez-Fraile for many discussions about effective
% field theories; Peter Schichtel for helping me set up and use
% \toolfont{MadMax}; and Torben Schell, who was an unwavering source of
% physics knowledge as well as a saviour in the hour of incomprehensible
% linker errors.

% From Marstall lunches to ``class trips'' to Pheno, with nut cakes, PhD
% hats and the eternal coffee list, the Heidelberg pheno group was akin
% to a second home in the last three years. I would like to thank Martin
% Bauer, Anke Biek\"otter, Katja B\"ohnke, Anja Butter, Nishita Desai,
% Karin Firnkes, Josua G\"ocking, Juan Gonzalez-Fraile, Jamil Hetzel,
% Sebastian Hoof, Jan Horak, Thomas Hugle, J\"org J\"ackel, Florian
% Jetter, Martin Klassen, Lara Kuhn, Rabea Link, Viraf Mehta, Luminita
% Mihaila, Rhea Moutafis, Tilman Plehn, Peter Reimitz, Michael Russel,
% Torben Schell, Sebastian Schenk, Peter Schichtel, Linda Shen, Beatriz
% Tapia Oregui, Jamie Tattersall, Valentin Tenorth, Jennifer Thompson,
% Susanne Westhoff, and Nikolai Zerf. I am grateful to Anke, Patrick,
% and Sebastian for the awesome wine\,\&\,cheese seminar. But most of
% all, I would like to thank Anja and Torben, who shared nearly the
% entire PhD journey with me. Without the two, these three years would
% not have been half as much fun.

\blackout{Further away from the Philosophenweg, I want to thank the friends
whose company I enjoyed during the last years. I cannot list everyone
here, but there is enough space for a shout out to the Dossenheim
gang\,---\,Marcel Gutsche, Clemens Hassel, and Julia Velte\,---\,and
to Christina Eilers. I want to especially thank Astrid Hiller Blin for
teaching me one thing or two, for loving the academic life, and for
jump-starting my days over coffee and arXiv. A big thank you to my
parents, who were always there when I needed them, and to my awesome
sisters. And then there is Merle, who I cannot thank enough, who in
just about any circumstances makes life better.}

\blackout{If this thesis is legible, it is only because of the trustworthy proof
readers. A big thanks to Anja and Juan, and in particular to Astrid
and Merle, who were crazy enough to read the whole thing from front to
end.}

\blackout{To all these people, I am lucky to know you, to work with you, and to
enjoy your company. Thank you.}
