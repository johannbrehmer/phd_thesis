Without doubt, the three years of my PhD were an amazing time. 
% Without doubt, I enjoyed the three years of my PhD tremendously.

For that, I first want to thank my adviser Tilman Plehn: for taking me
on as a student, for working with me on interesting physics, and for
disagreeing with me on countless questions over coffee. But most of
all, I am sincerely grateful to him for always having my back. This
includes him coming into the office on a Sunday morning to get me a
backup laptop when mine broke down days before a deadline.
%
% His support is also, I
% suspect, responsible for the postdoc offers I got.
%
% and, I suspect, some severe
% pulling of strings to make sure I got postdoc offers.
%
% And last but certainly not least, I am grateful to him for clearing
% the way to an academic career for me, even though I finally decided
% against this path.

I would like to thank Bj\"orn Malte Sch\"afer for reading and
refereeing this thesis, and Monica Dunford and Wolfgang Schlegel for
completing my examination committee. Further praise is reserved until
after the defence.

The Research Training Group `Particle physics at the LHC' (DFG GRK
1940) paid my salary and, together with the Heidelberg Graduate School
of Fundamental Physics, my travels. I am grateful for their support.

During my different projects, I had the great pleasure to
collaborate with a number of amazing scientists. Ayres Freitas and
David L\'opez-Val saw me off to a great start and taught me a
lot. Anke Biek\"otter joined us a little later, giving fresh impetus
to our research. Chasing the diboson ambulance with JoAnne Hewett,
Joachim Kopp, Tom Rizzo, and Jamie Tattersall was a wild and fun
ride. But one of the best ideas during my PhD was to grab a beer with
Kyle Cranmer in Caf\'e Botanik. Working with him was inspiring, and
was even more fun once Felix Kling joined our team.

The work presented in this thesis benefited greatly from discussions
with others. In particular I would like to express my gratitude to
Anja Butter for keeping me on track with sharp questions, Juan
Gonz\'alez Fraile for teaching me one thing or two about effective field
theories, Peter Schichtel for helping me set up and use
\toolfont{MadMax}, and Torben Schell, who is an unwavering source of
physics knowledge as well as a saviour in the hour of incomprehensible
linker errors.

From Marstall lunches to Pheno `class trips', with nut cakes, PhD
hats, and the eternal coffee list, the Heidelberg pheno group was akin
to a second home in the last three years. I would like to thank Martin
Bauer, Anke Biek\"otter, Katja B\"ohnke, Anja Butter, Nishita Desai,
Karin Firnkes, Josua G\"ocking, Juan Gonz\'alez Fraile, Jamil Hetzel,
Sebastian Hoof, Jan Horak, Thomas Hugle, J\"org J\"ackel, Martin
Jankowiak, Florian Jetter, Martin Klassen, Lara Kuhn, Rabea Link,
Viraf Mehta, Luminita Mihaila, Rhea Moutafis, Tilman Plehn, Peter
Reimitz, Michael Russel, Torben Schell, Sebastian Schenk, Peter
Schichtel, Linda Shen, Beatriz Tapia Oregui, Jamie Tattersall,
Valentin Tenorth, Jennifer Thompson, Susanne Westhoff, and Nikolai
Zerf. I am grateful to Anke Biek\"otter, Patrick Foldenauer, and
Sebastian Schenk for the awesome wine\,\&\,cheese seminar. Most of
all, I would like to thank Anja Butter and Torben Schell, who shared
nearly the entire PhD journey with me. Without the two, these three
years would not have been half as much fun.

Further away from the Philosophenweg, I would like to thank the
friends whose company I enjoyed during the last years, and in
particular give a shout out to the Dossenheim gang\,---\,Marcel
Gutsche, Clemens Hassel, and Julia Velte\,---\,and to Christina
Eilers. I want to especially thank Astrid Hiller Blin for
jump-starting many of my days over coffee and arXiv, and for frequently
cheering me up (and on). A big thank you goes to my marvellous parents
Antje and Andreas Brehmer. And then there is Merle Reinhart, who I
cannot thank enough and who in just about any circumstances makes life
better.

If this thesis is legible, it is largely due to the trustworthy
proof readers. A big thanks to Anja Butter, Anke Biek\"otter, Eric
Miller, Juan Gonz\'alez Fraile, Martin Bauer, Nikolai Zerf, Patrick
Foldenauer, and Sebastian Schenk. In particular, I am indebted to
Antje Brehmer, Astrid Hiller Blin, and Merle Reinhart, who were crazy
enough to read the whole thing from front to end.

% To all of you, a heartfelt thank you.
