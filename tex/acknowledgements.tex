% Without doubt, the three years of my PhD were an amazing time. 

% Without doubt, I enjoyed the three years of my PhD tremendously.

%Even though they may have left me with a caffeine addiction, I
%tremendously enjoyed the three years of my PhD.

For the three fun years my PhD turned out to be, I first want to
thank my advisor Tilman Plehn: for taking me on as a student, for
working with me on interesting physics, and for disagreeing with me on
countless questions over coffee. But most of all, I am sincerely
grateful to him for always having my back. This includes him coming
into the office on a Sunday morning to get me a backup laptop when
mine broke down days before a deadline.
%
% His support is also, I
% suspect, responsible for the postdoc offers I got.
%
% and, I suspect, some severe
% pulling of strings to make sure I got postdoc offers.
%
% And last but certainly not least, I am grateful to him for clearing
% the way to an academic career for me, even though I finally decided
% against this path.

I would like to thank Bj\"orn Malte Sch\"afer for reading and
refereeing this thesis, and Monica Dunford and Wolfgang Schlegel for
completing my examination committee.

%Further praise is reserved until
%after the defence.

The Research Training Group `Particle physics at the LHC' (DFG GRK
1940) paid my salary and, together with the Heidelberg Graduate School
of Fundamental Physics, my travels. I am grateful for their support.

I had the great pleasure to collaborate with a number of extraordinary
scientists. Ayres Freitas and David L\'opez-Val saw me off to a great
start and taught me a lot. Anke Biek\"otter joined us a little later,
giving fresh impetus to our research. Chasing the diboson ambulance
with JoAnne Hewett, Joachim Kopp, Tom Rizzo, and Jamie Tattersall was
a wild and fun ride. But one of the best ideas during my PhD was to
grab a beer with Kyle Cranmer in Caf\'e Botanik. Working with him was
inspiring, and was even more fun once Felix Kling joined our team.

The work presented in this thesis benefited greatly from discussions
with others. In particular I would like to express my gratitude to
Anja Butter for keeping me on track with sharp questions, Juan
Gonz\'alez Fraile for teaching me one thing or two about effective
field theories, Torben Schell for being an unwavering source of physics
knowledge as well as a saviour in the hour of incomprehensible linker
errors, and Peter Schichtel for helping me set up
\toolfont{MadMax}.

From Marstall lunches to Pheno `class trips', with nut cakes, PhD
hats, and the eternal coffee list,
%
I thoroughly enjoyed being part of the Heidelberg pheno group.
%
% the Heidelberg pheno group was akin to a second home in the last
% three years.

I would like to thank Martin Bauer, Elias Bernreuther, Anke
Biek\"otter, Katja B\"ohnke, Anja Butter, Daniel Camargo, Nishita
Desai, Karin Firnkes, Josua G\"ocking, Juan Gonz\'alez Fraile, Jamil
Hetzel, Sebastian Hoof, Jan Horak, Thomas Hugle, J\"org J\"ackel,

Peter Reimitz, Michael Russel, Torben Schell, Sebastian Schenk, Peter
Schichtel, Linda Shen, Beatriz Tapia Oregui, Jamie Tattersall,
Valentin Tenorth, Jennifer Thompson, Susanne Westhoff, and Nikolai
Zerf. I am grateful to Anke Biek\"otter, Patrick Foldenauer, and
Sebastian Schenk for wine and cheese. Most of all, I would like to
thank Anja Butter and Torben Schell, who shared nearly the entire PhD
journey with me. Without the two, these three years would not have
been half as much fun.

Further away from the Philosophenweg, I would like to thank the
friends whose company I enjoyed during the last years, and in
particular give a shout out to the Dossenheim gang\,---\,Marcel
Gutsche, Clemens Hassel, and Julia Velte\,---\,and to Christina
Eilers. I want to thank Astrid Hiller Blin for jump-starting many of
my days over coffee and arXiv, and for unfailingly cheering me up (and
on). A big thank you goes to my marvellous parents Antje and Andreas
Brehmer. And then there is Merle Reinhart, who I cannot thank enough
and who in just about any circumstances makes life better.

If this thesis is legible, it is largely due to the trustworthy proof
readers. I am grateful to Martin Bauer, Anke Biek\"otter, Anja Butter,
Patrick Foldenauer, Juan Gonz\'alez Fraile, Eric Miller, and Sebastian
Schenk. In particular, I am indebted to Astrid Hiller Blin, Antje
Brehmer, and Merle Reinhart, who were crazy enough to read the whole
thing front to back.

% To all of you, a heartfelt thank you.
