\firstword{I}{n this chapter} we review some of the essential concepts
that underlie the research presented in the next chapters. First, we
briefly summarise the role of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model
(SM) and its phenomenology at the LHC.
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_eft} then presents a pedagogical
introduction to the effective field theory (EFT) idea. In
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_higgs_eft} we combine these ideas and
introduce Standard Model effective field theory as a universal
language for Higgs physics.

Our introduction to Higgs physics will be superficial, and the EFT
part eschews mathematical rigour for a broad picture of the central
ideas. For a more thorough introduction to Higgs physics, see for
instance Ref.~\cite{Plehn:2009nd}. For an extensive introduction to
EFTs, see Refs.~\cite{Georgi:1994qn,Kaplan:2005es}. Note that the EFT
section is almost identical to a lecture given in
Heidelberg~\cite{Brehmer:EFTlecture} and many arguments and examples
are taken from Refs.~\cite{Georgi:1994qn,Kaplan:2005es}.

\subsection{The Standard Model Higgs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field appears as an $SU(2)$ doublet $\phi$ as
%
\begin{multline}
  \lgr{SM} \supset (D^\mu \phi)^\dagger (D_\mu \phi) - \mu^2 \phisq - \lambda (\phisq)^2 \\
            - \sum_{\text{generations}} \left(    y_u {\twovec {\overbar u} {\overbar d}}_L \tilde \phi \, u_{R} 
                                                           + y_d {\twovec {\overbar u} {\overbar d}}_L \phi \, d_{R}
                                                           + y_\ell {\twovec {\overbar \nu} {\overbar \ell^-}}_L \phi \, \ell_{R}   \right )
  \label{eq:foundations_sm_lagrangian}
\end{multline}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
  D_\mu \phi = \left( \partial_\mu - \im g \frac {\sigma^a} 2 W^a_\mu
    - \im \frac {g'} 2 B_\mu \right) \phi
  \label{eq:foundations_covariant_derivative}
\end{equation}
%
and $\tilde{\phi} = \im \tau_2 \phi^*$. For $\mu^2 < 0$, the Higgs
doublet develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev)
%
\begin{equation}
  v^2 \equiv 2 \left| \braket{\phi} \right|^2  = - \frac {\mu^2} \lambda \,.
\end{equation}
%
Using some of the gauge freedom, we can rotate the Higgs field such that
%
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}} \twovec  {-w_2 - \im w_1} {v + h + \im w_3} \,,
  \label{eq:foundations_sm_phi}
\end{equation} 
%
where $w_i$ are the would-be Goldstone bosons that give mass to the
$W$ and $Z$ bosons, and $h$ is the physical Higgs boson.

Plugging Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_sm_phi} into
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_sm_lagrangian}, we find the Higgs mass
%
\begin{equation}
  m_h^2 = {-2\mu^2} = {2\lambda} v^2 \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_higgs_mass_sm}
\end{equation}

The fermions and the massive vector bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$ get mass
terms proportional to $v$, as well as couplings to the Higgs boson
$h$. Since both terms stem from the same coupling to
$\phi \sim v + h$, the Higgs couplings to other particles are always
proportional to $g_{hxx} \sim m_x / v$. Finally, there are $h^3$ and
$h^4$ self-couplings. The SM Higgs sector is very predictive: With the
measurement of the Higgs mass $m_h = 125~\gev$~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,
  Chatrchyan:2012xdj, Khachatryan:2016vau}, there are no more free
parameters in the SM and all couplings are fixed.

    the most important Higgs production modes considered in this
    thesis. Left: gluon fusion. Middle: weak boson fusion. Right:

  \label{fig:foundations_production_diag}
\end{figure}

At the LHC, most Higgs bosons are produced in \emph{gluon-gluon
  fusion} as shown in the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_production_diag}. Due to its large Yukawa
coupling, the top plays the dominant role in the loop, with small
contributions from the bottom. The total cross section at
$\sqrt{s} = 13~\tev$ is approximately
$49~\pb$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}, a large part of which comes NLO and
NNLO corrections. This sizeable rate comes at the price of a lack of
discerning kinematic features that could help to separate the Higgs
from backgrounds.

This is certainly different for Higgs production in \emph{weak boson
  fusion} (WBF)\footnote{The common name Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)
  forgets that the gluon also has spin 1.}, as shown in the middle
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_production_diag}. The production
rate for this quark-initiated process is only
$3.8~\pb$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}, but the Higgs is accompanied by
two high-energetic jets that point nearly back-to-back in the two
forward regions of the detector. This translates to a large invariant
mass $m_{jj}$ between them as well as a large separation in
(pseudo-)rapidity $\Delta \eta_{jj}$. A second important property is
provided by the colour structure of the process: at leading order,
there is no colour exchange between the two quark lines, which means
there is very little QCD radiation in this process. Both of these
features set the WBF process apart from QCD backgrounds, which
typically have many central jets. Backgrounds can therefore be reduced
significantly by requiring two so-called ``tagging jets'' with large
$\Delta \eta_{jj}$ and large $m_{jj}$, and vetoing any additional
central jets~\cite{Rainwater:1998kj}.

But the tagging jets are not only useful to discriminate Higgs
production from non-Higgs backgrounds. Since they recoil against the
intermediate vector bosons that couple to the Higgs, they provide
access to the momentum flow through the Higgs production vertex. Their
properties, in particular their transverse momenta and the angular
correlations between them, thus provide probes of the Higgs-gauge
coupling. We will revisit this point from different perspectives, and
tagging jet observables will play an important role throughout this
thesis.

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_production_diag}
shows Higgs production in association with a vector boson, or
\emph{Higgs-strahlung}. The rate is $1.4~\pb$ for a $Wh$ final state
plus $0.9~\pb$ for $Zh$. Similarly to the tagging jets in WBF, the
final-state gauge boson both helps to discriminate the Higgs from
backgrounds and provides a handle to access the momentum flow through
the virtual intermediate vector boson.

We will also briefly analyse \emph{Higgs production with a single top
  quark}. This process exists as an $s$-channel and a $t$-channel
version with very different kinematic features, and can be calculated
either in the four-flavour scheme (with a gluon in the initial state)
or in the five-flavour scheme (with a $b$ quark in the initial
state). We will focus on the dominant $t$-channel process and
calculate it in the five-flavour scheme, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_th_diag}. Diagrams where the Higgs is
radiated off a top quark interfere destructively with amplitudes in
which the Higgs couples to a $W$. The SM rate is small at
$74~\fb$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}, but this interference pattern makes
it very sensitive to changes in the top Yukawa coupling. This process
is in fact the only direct probe of the sign or phase of the top
Yukawa coupling ($t \bar{t} h$ production is only sensitive to the
absolute value of the top Yukawa, while the total rate in gluon fusion
can be influenced by many effects such as new particles in the loop).

  \caption[Feynman diagrams for Higgs pair production]{Feynman

\end{figure}

Finally, we will take a look at \emph{Higgs pair production} which
provides a measurement of the Higgs self-coupling, see
Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_hh_diag}. It is another example of
destructive interference between different amplitudes: diagrams in
which the two Higgses couple to a top box loop interfere with
those in which a single Higgs is produced in gluon fusion and then
splits into two Higgses through the self-coupling. Close to threshold,
these two contributions approximately cancel in the SM, and the total
rate is very small at $33~\fb$. Modified Higgs sectors can spoil this
cancellation and increase the rate drastically.


\newparagraph
%
The Higgs decay patterns are rather simple. Since it couples to all
particles proportional to their mass, it prefers to decay into the
heaviest particles allowed by phase space. The dominant decay mode
with a branching ratio of $58 \%$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz} are
therefore $b\bar{b}$ pairs. This signature is clearly useless for
Higgs bosons produced in gluon fusion because of the overwhelming QCD
$gg \to b \bar{b}$ background. WBF and $Vh$ production provide handles
to tame these backgrounds, but the channel is still difficult. Easier
to detect are $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pairs with a branching ratio of
$6.3 \%$. Their semi-leptonic and purely leptonic decays involve
neutrinos. But if the taus are boosted enough and not exactly
back-to-back, the neutrino momentum can be reconstructed for instance
using a collinear approximation~\cite{Plehn:2009nd}.

The decays through $W^+W^-$ or $ZZ$ pairs into four-lepton final states
are particularly important due to their clean signatures and because
they provide access to Higgs-gauge couplings. Since the Higgs mass is
below the $W^+W^-$ and $ZZ$  thresholds, one of the vectors has to be
off-shell.\footnote{This also means that branching ratios for
  $h\to ZZ$ and $h \to WW$ are not really well-defined. What is often
  quoted is in fact a term like
  $\br(h \to 4 \ell) / (\br(Z \to \ell^+ \ell^-))^2$.}
$h \to W^+W^- \to (\ell^+ \nu) (\ell^- \overbar{\nu})$ with $\ell = e, \mu$ has a
respectable branching fraction of $1.1 \%$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz},
but comes with two neutrinos in the final state. Still, it is one of
the most important channels to measure WBF Higgs production. The decay
$h \to ZZ \to 4 \ell$ with $\ell = e, \mu$ provides an extremely
clean signal. Despite its small branching ratio of
$1.3 \cdot 10^{-4}$, it was one of the main Higgs discovery
channels~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Khachatryan:2016vau}. From a post-discovery
perspective, its four leptons provide a rich spectrum of angular
correlations and other observables that allow us to measure the Higgs
behaviour in detail. We will discuss this feature in more detail
later.

Finally, the small tree-level couplings of the Higgs to light
particles mean that the loop-induced decay into photon pairs can
compete with them. The dominant contribution comes from a $W$ loop,
which interferes destructively with the top loop, resulting in a
branching ratio of $0.23 \%$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. The ATLAS and
CMS detectors are designed to reconstruct photons well, in fact with
exactly this Higgs decay channel in mind. Together with $h \to 4 \ell$
it constitutes the most important channel for the discovery.

\subsection{How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Higgs}
\label{sec:foundations_relevance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are several facets of the Higgs boson that make it special. From
an experimental point of view, the properties of this shiny new thing
in particle physics are still relatively unknown. Its couplings to
vector bosons and heavy fermions are constrained at the $\ord{10\%}$
level, while for the couplings to light fermions, invisible decays,
and the total decay width of the Higgs there are only weak upper
bounds~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau, Corbett:2015ksa}. Many of these
limits also rely on specific model assumptions. The top Yukawa
coupling, for instance, is most strongly constrained from the total
Higgs production rate, but only under the assumption that there no new
physics plays a role in the gluon-fusion loop. The total Higgs width
can be constrained indirectly from the contribution of
$g g \to h \to ZZ \to 4 \ell$ in the off-shell Higgs region, but again
relying on strong model assumptions. All in all, the Higgs is still
the least well measured elementary particle (in some sense with the
exception of neutrinos), leaving plenty room for physics beyond the
Standard Model.

\newparagraph
%
From a theory perspective, there are several reasons to suspect
manifestations of new physics in the Higgs sector. Starting with a
rather general argument, the Higgs doublet is the key component of
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), which is often seen as the very
core of the SM construction. A test of the Higgs properties therefore
provides a test of the fundamental structure of Nature.

The Higgs boson is the only fundamental scalar discovered so far. This
is interesting in its own right, but also leads to the famous
electroweak \emph{hierarchy problem}: in the absence of any protective
symmetry, the mass of a scalar field should receive quantum
corrections of the order of the largest scale in the theory. If the SM
is valid all the way to the Planck scale, severe fine-tuning between
the bare parameter and these quantum corrections is necessary to keep
the electroweak mass scale at the observed value. Note that this
argument interchangeably applies to the mass parameter of the Higgs
doublet $\mu^2$, the physical Higgs mass $m_h$, or the electroweak vev
$v$. Since the strength of the weak force is suppressed by powers of
$m_W \sim v$, and the gravitational force by the Planck scale, the
hierarchy problem is often phrased in terms of the surprising weakness
of gravity compared to the weak force. This naturalness problem is of
a purely aesthetic nature, but similar aesthetic problems have in the
past led to new insights. Many models have been proposed to solve the
hierarchy by introducing a new symmetry that protects the Higgs mass
against quantum corrections.\footnote{An entirely different and
  somewhat metaphysical argument is based on the (weak) anthropic
  principle that observations of the universe are conditional upon its
  laws of physics allowing conscious life~\cite{Weinberg:1987dv,
    Barrow:1988yia}. First, this explanation requires some mechanism
  that generates many different vacua with different values of the
  physics parameters, including the Higgs mass. Most of these vacua
  will have ``natural'' parameters in which the weak and gravitational
  scales are comparable. String theory is hypothesised to provide such
  a sampling mechanism (the ``multiverse''). Second, there has to be a
  reason why larger (and thus more abundant) values of the weak scale
  would not allow any type of intelligent life to form and make
  observations. This question is difficult to answer, and the jury is
  still out~\cite{Agrawal:1997gf, Harnik:2006vj, Clavelli:2006di,
    Giudice:2008bi, Donoghue:2009me, Gedalia:2010iy,
    Adams:2015hvd}. Given the speculative nature of the two questions,
  anthropic reasoning is being criticised as unverifiable or as based
  on arguments from lack of imagination. Some other models such as the
  relaxion~\cite{Graham:2015cka} or
  Nnaturalness~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2016rle} modify the cosmological
  evolution such that a small Higgs mass is generated dynamically
  during inflation or reheating.}\comment{Citation needed for
  criticism of anthropic principle.} Famous examples are
supersymmetry, composite Higgs models in which the Higgs is the
pseudo-Goldstone boson of some broken symmetry, conformal
symmetries~\cite{Bardeen:1995kv}, or extra dimensions. To reduce
tuning to an acceptable level, this new physics should reside at
energy scales not too far from the electroweak scale. These models
usually modify the Higgs sector in a way that translates into Higgs
couplings different from their SM values.

Another hierarchy unexplained in the SM is the large difference
between the \emph{fermion masses}. There are more than five orders of
magnitude between the top and the electron mass, and neutrinos are
even lighter. Since the fermion masses are generated by the Yukawa
couplings of the Higgs doublet, models that explain the fermion masses
will usually also shift the Higgs-fermion coupling patterns.

The question of \emph{vacuum stability} is still being discussed. The
renormalisation group (RG) allows us to link this question
to the running the quartic coupling $\lambda$ to higher
energies. Current results~\cite{Degrassi:2012ry} indicate that indeed
the quartic coupling becomes negative at large energies, leading to a
second vacuum with lower energy at much larger values of
$\phi$. Fortunately for us, the tunnelling probability is very small,
and in the SM ``our'' vacuum with $v \approx 246~\gev$ seems to be
metastable with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe. While
this indicates there is no pressing need for physics below the Planck
scale to save the electroweak vacuum from a horrible fate, this result
crucially depends on the measured top and Higgs masses, higher-order
corrections to the beta functions, and higher-dimensional operators
stemming from UV physics~\cite{Eichhorn:2015kea}.

In addition to these theoretical and to some degree aesthetic
arguments, there is solid experimental evidence for physics beyond the
SM that might be linked to the Higgs sector. First, the nature of
\emph{dark matter} (DM)~\cite{Plehn:DM} is still unclear. It is experimentally
established that this form of matter is electrically neutral, stable
over cosmological timescales, clumps (i.\,e.\ is now
non-relativistic), and makes up roughly a fourth of the energy density
of the universe. In many models DM is in thermal equilibrium with
ordinary matter in the early universe. Interestingly, the observed
dark matter density is in good agreement with electroweak-scale masses
and weak couplings. This ``WIMP miracle'' is one main reason behind
the popularity of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as DM
candidates. In this scenario, good candidates for the mediator between
dark matter and the SM are the Higgs boson or other scalars in an
extended Higgs sector. Such ``Higgs portal'' scenarios often predict
signatures in Higgs physics such as modified couplings or invisible
Higgs decays.

Another mystery is the \emph{matter-antimatter asymmetry} of the
universe. Assuming that the cosmos was initially perfectly symmetric,
the observed excess of matter can be generated dynamically if the
three Sakharov conditions are satisfied: there have to be processes
with baryon-number violation as well as $C$ and $CP$ violation, which
take place out of thermal equilibrium. In the SM, these effects are
too small to account for the observed asymmetry. Models that
accommodate larger effects often affect the Higgs sector. In
particular, extended Higgs sectors allow for electroweak symmetry
breaking to be a strong first-order phase transition, providing the
required out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Again, such scenarios predict
signatures in Higgs measurements.

Finally, the Higgs could play another role in the cosmological
evolution of the universe. The origin of the large-scale structure of
the cosmos, the surprising isotropy of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), and the flatness of the Universe are all explained by an epoch
of exponential expansion of space in the early universe called
\emph{inflation}. This process is often thought to be cause by a
scalar field, the inflaton, slowly rolling down a potential of a
certain shape. In principle the Higgs can be the inflaton, though this
scenario of Higgs inflation requires unnaturally large couplings
between the Higgs and the Ricci scalar, and requires a UV completion.

The null results of the LHC searches for new particles have led to
some disappointment among particle physicists. But with the discovery
of the Higgs boson, the LHC might not only have completed the SM
particle zoo, but rather opened the door to the unknown.  The Higgs
boson is not just another SM particle.  Some of the big open questions
of fundamental physics are deeply rooted in the Higgs sector, and many
other ideas can at least be linked to the Higgs sector under some
assumptions. On the other hand, the current experimental precision
leaves quite some room for signatures of new physics in Higgs
observables. A precise determination of the Higgs properties might be
one of the most exciting measurements at the LHC, and will hopefully
improve our understanding of Nature significantly. Hopefully, the
Higgs boson is not just the last puzzle piece of the Standard Model,
but the first sign of what lies beyond.

This plethora of possible BSM models means that a model-independent
universal theory framework is invaluable for TeV signatures of new
physics. We will consider such a model based on the effective field
theory (EFT) paradigm. Before discussing the specific realisation for
Higgs physics in the next section, here we give a general introduction
to the EFT idea.

The EFT idea is a very general tool that plays a role in many, if not
all, areas of physics. Whenever phenomena are spread out over
different energy or length scales, an effective description can be
valuable, either to simplify calculations, or to actually allow
model-independent statements that would be impossible without such a
framework.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Different physics at different scales}
\label{sec:foundations_scales}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our world behaves very differently depending on which energy and
length scales we look at. At extremely high energies (or short
distances), Nature might be described by a quantum theory of
gravity. At energies of a few hundred GeV, the Standard Model is
(disappointingly) in agreement with all measurements. Going to lower
energies (or larger distances), we do not have to worry about Higgs or
$W$ bosons anymore: electromagnetic interactions are described by QED,
weak interactions by Fermi theory, strong physics by QCD. Below a GeV,
quarks and gluons are replaced by pions and nucleons as the relevant
degrees of freedom. Then by nuclei, atoms, molecules. At this point
most physicists give up and let chemists (and ultimately biologists
and sociologists) analyse the systems.

The important point here is that the observables at one scale are not
directly sensitive to the physics at significantly different
scales. This is nothing new: for molecules to stick together, the
details of the Higgs sector are not relevant, just as we can calculate how
an apple falls from a tree without knowing about quantum gravity. To
do physics at one scale, we do not have to (and often cannot) take
into account the physics from all other scales. Instead, we isolate
only those features that play a role at the scale of interest.

An effective field theory is a physics model that includes all effects
relevant at a given scale, but not those that only play a role at
significantly different scales. In particular, EFTs ignore spatial
substructures much smaller than the lengths of interest, or effects at
much higher energies than the energy scale of interest.
% In other words, EFTs provide an organized way of approximating
% phenomena that\,---\,at a scale of interest\,---\,are very small as
% zero, and quantities that are very large as infinite.

We will often use examples with one full or underlying theory and
one effective theory. For simplicity, we pretend that the full theory
describes physics correctly at all scales. The EFT is a simpler model
than the full theory and neglects some phenomena (such as heavy
particles) at energy scale $\Lambda$. However, it correctly describes
the physics as long as the observables probe energy scales
%
\begin{equation}
  E \ll \Lambda \,,
  \label{eq:foundations_scale_separation}
\end{equation}
%
within some finite precision. This \emph{scale hierarchy} between the
energy of interest and the scale of high-energy physics not included
in the EFT is the basic requirement for the EFT idea. A validity
range~\eqref{eq:foundations_scale_separation} is a fundamental property of each
EFT.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fermi theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The textbook example for an EFT is Fermi theory, which
describes the charged current interactions between quarks (or
hadrons), leptons and neutrinos at low energies. The underlying model
here is the SM, in which this weak interaction is mediated by the
exchange of virtual $W$ bosons with mass $m_W$ and coupling constant
$g$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_\text{full} \sim {}

    %}
  }
  {} \sim - \frac {g^2} {p^2 - m_W^2}
  \label{eq:foundations_4fermion_full}
\end{equation}
%
In Fermi theory, there are no $W$ bosons, just a direct
interaction between four fermions with coupling constant
$G_F \propto g^2 / m_W^2$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M}_\text{EFT} \sim {}
  \raisebox{-0.5\height}{
    %\fbox{
      \fmfframe(0,10)(0,10){ %(L,T) (R,B)

      }
    %}
  }
  {} \sim G_F \propto \frac {g^2} {m_W^2}
  \label{eq:foundations_4fermion_EFT}
\end{equation}
%
So the EFT turns the $W$ propagator into a contact interaction between
the fermions, shrinking the distance bridged by the virtual $W$ to
zero. Clearly, the two amplitudes agree as long as the momentum
transfer through the vertex is small,
$E^2 = p^2 \ll \Lambda^2 = m_W^2$:
%
\begin{equation}
  - \frac {g^2} {p^2 - m_W^2}
  = \frac {g^2} {m_W^2} \left(1 +  \frac {p^2} {m_W^2} + \ord{p^4/m_W^4} \right)
  \approx  \frac {g^2} {m_W^2} \,.
\end{equation}

One process described by this interaction is muon decay. Its typical
energy scale $E \approx m_\mu$ is well separated from $\Lambda = m_W$,
and Fermi theory will describe the process quite accurately. The
relative \emph{EFT error}, i.\,e.\ the mistake we make when
calculating an observable with the EFT rather than with the full
model, should be of order $\Delta_\text{EFT} = \Gamma_\text{EFT} / \Gamma_\text{full}  \sim E^2 / \Lambda^2 \sim m_\mu^2 / m_W^2 \approx 10^{-6}$.

In proton collisions at the LHC the same interaction takes place, but
at potentially much larger momentum transfer $E < 13$~TeV. The EFT
error increases with $E$. For $E \gtrsim m_W$, the full model allows
on-shell $W$ production, a feature entirely missing in the EFT. Here
the two descriptions obviously diverge and Fermi theory is no longer a
valid approximation of the weak interaction.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Down and up the theory ladder}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In reality there are of course more than two theories, and the notion
of underlying and effective model becomes relative. The SM itself is
not valid up to arbitrary large energies: it does not explain dark
matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry, or gravity. It is probably
also internally inconsistent since at some very large energy the
quartic coupling $\lambda$ and the coupling constant $g'$ hit Landau
poles. So the SM is an effective theory with validity range
$E \ll \Lambda \le M_{Pl}$ and has to be replaced by some other
description at larger energies. On the other hand, going to energies
lower than a few GeV, the relevant physics changes again and we should
switch to a new effective theory. In this way, all theories can be
thought of as a series of EFTs, where the model valid at one scale is
the underlying model for the effective theory at the next lower scale.

If you think you know a theory that describes our world at
sufficiently large energies, then in principle there is no need to use
effective theories: you can calculate every single observable in your
full model (at least if the full model is perturbative at these
energies or other approximations such as lattice calculations are
available). This will however make hard calculations necessary even
for the simplest low-energy processes. One can save a lot of
computational effort and focus on the relevant physics by dividing the
phase space into regions with different appropriate effective
descriptions.

Starting from a high energy scale where the parameters of the
fundamental theory are defined, these parameters are run to lower
energies until the physics changes substantially. At this
\emph{matching scale} an effective theory is constructed from the full
model, and its coefficients are determined from, or matched to, the
underlying model. Then the coefficients of this EFT are run down to
the next matching scale, where a new EFT is defined and its parameters
are calculated, and so on. This is the \emph{top-down} view of
EFTs. For instance, we can start from the SM and construct Fermi
theory as a simpler model valid at low energies. While we can
certainly use the SM to calculate the muon lifetime, it is not
necessary, and a calculation in Fermi theory is quite accurate and
simpler.

But often we do not know the underlying theory. As mentioned above,
there has to be physics beyond the SM, and there is still hope it will
appear around a few TeV. If we want to parametrise the effects of such
new physics on electroweak-scale observables, we do not know how the
full model looks like. But even without knowing the underlying model,
we can still construct an effective field theory based on a few very
general assumptions. We will go through these ingredients in the next
section. For this \emph{bottom-up} approach, an effective theory is
not only useful, but actually the only way we can discuss new physics
without choosing a particular model of BSM physics.

High-energy physics can be seen as the field of working ourselves up a
chain of EFTs to ever higher energies. But how does this chain end?
Does it end at all? Even if we one day find a consistent theory that
can explain all observations to date, how would we check if it indeed
describes Nature up to arbitrarily high energies? Understanding all
theories as effective, these questions do not matter! The EFT
framework provides us with the tools to do physics without having to
worry about the far ultraviolet.

% To summarize this introduction, the basic EFT idea is to take into
% account only the phenomena relevant at the scale of interest. With
% this broad definition one can even say that effective theories are
% pretty much the only way we can do physics at all. The question is
% not \emph{if} one should use an EFT for a given process (after all,
% what would be the alternative?), but \emph{which} effective theory
% is the best one for a given process, especially in light of the
% validity range of all effective theories.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{EFT construction and the bottom-up approach}
\label{sec:foundations_eft_bottom_up}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

EFTs are especially useful in the framework of quantum field theory
(QFT). Before showing how to construct the effective operators of such
a theory in a bottom-up approach, let us recapitulate how QFTs are
organised.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Reminder: operators and power counting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The basic object describing perturbative QFTs in $d=4$ flat space-time
dimensions is the action
%
\begin{equation}
  S = \intfourx \lgr{}(x) \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_action}
\end{equation}
%
The Lagrangian $\lgr{}(x)$ is a sum of couplings times operators,
where the operators are combinations of fields and derivatives
evaluated at one point $x$. These are either kinematic terms, mass
terms or represent interactions between three or more fields. For
instance, the Lagrangian
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{} =  \im  \bar{\psi}_i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i - \frac 1 4 V_{\mu \nu} V^{\mu \nu} 
  - m_i \bar{\psi}_i \psi_i + m_V^2 V_\mu V^\mu
  - g \bar{\psi}_i \gamma_\mu \psi_i V^\mu
  \label{eq:foundations_action_V_fermions}
\end{equation}
%
with implicit sum over $i$ describes fermions $\psi_i$, a massive
vector boson $V_\mu$, and an interaction between them with coupling
$g$.\footnote{Massive vector bosons have issues with renormalisability
  and unitarity, which can be solved by generating the mass in a Higgs
  mechanism at a higher scale, but this irrelevant for the discussion
  here.}

A key property of each coupling or operator is its \emph{mass
  dimension}. In simple terms this can be formulated as the following
question: if you assign a value to a quantity, which power of a mass
unit such as GeV would this value carry? Since we work in units with
$\hbar = c = 1$, length and distance dimensions are just the inverse
of mass dimensions. We will denote the mass dimension of any object
with squared brackets, where $[\ope{}] = D$ means that $\ope{}$ is of
dimension mass$^D$, or mass dimension $D$.

In QFT, the action can appear in exponentials such as $e^{\im S}$, so
it must be dimensionless: $[S] = 0$. The space-time integral in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_action} then implies $[\lgr{}] = d = 4$, so every term
in the Lagrangian has to be of mass dimension 4. Applying this to the
kinetic terms, we can calculate the mass dimension of all fields. This
then allows us to calculate the mass dimension of operators and
couplings in the theory.

In the example in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_action_V_fermions}, the kinetic term
for the fermions contains one space-time derivative, $[\partial] =
1$.
To get $[\bar{\psi} \partial \psi] = 4$, the fermion fields must have
dimension $[\psi_i] = 3/2$. Similarly, the field strength $V_{\mu\nu}$
contains a derivative, so we end up with $[V_\mu] = 1$. With these
numbers we can check the other operators. In addition to the expected
$[m] = [m_V] = 1$, we find $[\bar{\psi} \psi V^\mu] = 4$ or $[g] = 0$.

The mass dimension of an operator has two important
consequences. First, the renormalisation group flow of a theory,
i.\,e.\ the running of the couplings between different energy scales,
largely depends on the mass dimensions of the operators. Operators
with mass dimension $D < d$ (``relevant'' operators) receive large
quantum corrections when going from large energies to low energies.
This is a key argument for many fine-tuning problems such as the
hierarchy problem or the cosmological constant problem. On the other
hand, operators with $D > d$ (``irrelevant'' ones) are typically
suppressed when going to lower energies. Operators with $D = d$ are
called ``marginal''.

The second consequence of the mass dimension affects the
renormalisability of a theory. Theories with operators with $D > d$
are \emph{non-renormalisable}:\footnote{The opposite is not true: some
  theories contain only operators with $D \le d$, but are still not
  renormalisable.} particles in loops with energies $E \to \infty$
will lead to infinities in observables, and they are too many to be
hidden in a renormalisation of the parameters.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Effective operators}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

From now on we will only consider EFTs realised as a local QFT in 4
space-time dimensions, an approach that has proven very successful in
high-energy physics so far. EFTs are then defined as a sum of
operators $\ope{i}$, each with a specific mass dimension $D_i$. We can
split the coupling in front of each operator into a dimensionless
constant, the \emph{Wilson coefficient} $f_i$, and some powers of a
mass scale, for which we use the scale of heavy physics $\Lambda$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{EFT} = (\text{kinetic and mass terms}) + \sum_i \frac {f_i} {\Lambda^{D_i - d}} \, \ope{i} \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_EFT_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
%
Why do we force $\Lambda$ to appear in front of the operators like
this? If we do not know anything about the underlying model at scale
$\Lambda$, our best guess (which can be motivated with arguments based
on the renormalisation group flow) is that it consists of
dimensionless couplings $g \sim \ord{1}$ and mass scales
$M \sim \ord{\Lambda}$. Indirect effects mediated by this high-energy
physics should therefore be proportional to a combination of these
factors, as given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_EFT_lagrangian} with
couplings $f_i \sim \ord{1}$. This is certainly true in Fermi theory,
where the effective coupling $G_F$ is suppressed by
$\Lambda^2 = m_W^2$.


  
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Full and effective descriptions of physics}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Let us go back to the simple picture of one full and one effective
% theory and summarise the typical differences between the two setups.
% %
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The full model contains high-energy physics, for instance heavy
%   particles with mass $\gtrsim \Lambda$ that are not dynamical degrees
%   of freedom in the EFT. In the effective model their effects are
%   mapped onto additional higher-dimensional operators involving only
%   the light fields.
% %
% \item At least in our simple picture we assume that the full model is
%   valid at all energies. The EFT, in any case, is only valid at
%   $E \ll \Lambda$. Only in this low-energy region the two descriptions
%   agree, at $E \gtrsim \Lambda$ the EFT predictions will not reproduce
%   the full model.
% %
% \item The full model is fully renormalisable, while the EFT is
%   typically only renormalisable order by order.
% %
% \item An interaction mediated by heavy fields in the full model is
%   described by the higher-dimensional operators in the EFT, see for
%   instance Esq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_4fermion_full} and
%   \eqref{eq:foundations_4fermion_EFT}. This means that the non-local
%   interaction in the full model is approximated as a local contact
%   interaction in the EFT.
% \end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Ingredients}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

How the operators $\ope{i}$ look like might be clear in a top-down
situation where we know the underlying theory. In a bottom-up
approach, however, we need a recipe to construct a list of operators
in a model-independent way. It turns out that this is surprisingly
straightforward, and the list of operators we need to include in the
EFT is defined by three ingredients: the particle content, the
symmetries, and a counting scheme that decides which operators are
relevant at the scale of interest. We will go through them one by one.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Particle content}: one has to define the fields that are
  the dynamical degrees of freedoms in the EFT, i.\,e.\ that can form
  either external legs or internal propagators in Feynman diagrams. At
  least all particles with masses $m \ll \Lambda$ should be
  included. The operators are then combinations of these fields and
  derivatives.
%
\item \emph{Symmetries}: some symmetry properties of the world have
  been measured with high precision, and we can expect that a
  violation of these symmetries has to be extremely small or happens
  at very high energies. These can be gauge symmetries (such as the
  $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ of the SM), space-time symmetries
  (such as Lorentz symmetry), or other global symmetries (such as
  flavour symmetries). Requiring that the effective operators do not
  violate these symmetries is well motivated and can reduce the
  complexity of the theory significantly.
%
\item \emph{Counting scheme}: with a set of particles and some
  symmetry requirements we can construct an infinite tower of
  different operators. We therefore need some rule to decide which of
  the operators we can neglect. Here the dimensionality of the
  operators becomes important. As argued above, we expect an operator
  with mass dimension $D > d$ to be suppressed by a factor of roughly
  $1 / \Lambda^{D-d}$. Operators of higher mass dimension are
  therefore more strongly suppressed. Setting a maximal operator
  dimension is thus a way of limiting the EFT to a finite number of
  operators that should include the leading effects at energies
  $E \ll \Lambda$.
\end{enumerate}

One property that is often required of theories is missing in this
list: an EFT (with its intrinsic UV cutoff $\Lambda$) does not have to
be renormalisable in the traditional sense. In fact, most EFTs include
operators with mass dimension $D > d$ and are thus non-renormalisable.
However, EFTs are still renormalisable order by order in the counting
scheme, and loop effects can be calculated without any fundamental
issues. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Basis choices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Usually not all operators that can be constructed in this way are
independent. This can be seen from a field redefinition of the form
%
\begin{equation}
  \phi(x) \to \phi'(x) = \phi(x) + \varepsilon f(x)
\end{equation}
%
where $\varepsilon$ is some small parameter and $f(x)$ can contain any
combination of fields evaluated at $x$. The action in terms of the new
field is then (after integration by parts)
%
\begin{equation}
  \intfourx \lgr{}[\phi] \to \intfourx \lgr{}[\phi']
  % &= \intfourx \left( \lgr{}[\phi] + \varepsilon \fder {\lgr{}} {\phi} f + \varepsilon \fder {\lgr{}} {\partial_\mu \phi} \partial_\mu f + \ord{\varepsilon^2} \right) \notag \\
  = \intfourx \left( \lgr{}[\phi] + \varepsilon \left[ \fder {\lgr{}} {\phi} - \partial_\mu \fder {\lgr{}} {\partial_\mu \phi} \right] f + \ord{\varepsilon^2} \right) \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_field_redefinitions}
\end{equation}
%
Such a transformation does not change the physics, i.\,e.\ the
$S$-matrix elements~\cite{Politzer:1980me, Georgi:1991ch, Arzt:1993gz,
  Simma:1993ky}, so we can equivalently use the new action instead of
the original one. In this way, each equation of motion provides us
with a degree of freedom to swap operators for a combination of other
operators. Similarly, Fierz identities and integration by parts can be
used to manipulate the form of operators. Together these tools reduces
the number of operators and coefficients necessary in an EFT basis,
and lead to some freedom to choose which operators to work with.



% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Fermi theory again}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %
% As an example, let us pretend to not know anything about the SM, and
% construct an EFT of the weak interaction around or below a few GeV.
% %
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Above $\Lambda_{QCD}$, the particle content is given by the
%   leptons and quarks, excluding the top. For a general EFT at these
%   energy scales we would have to include photons and gluons as well,
%   but for simplicity we will leave them out here. For energies below
%   $\Lambda_{QCD}$ we should in principle write down a different EFT
%   based on baryons and mesons, but this does not really change the
%   result.
% \item The low-energy symmetries observed at these energies are Lorentz
%   invariance as well as the conservation of electromagnetic charge,
%   lepton number, and baryon number. Since we already leave out the
%   gluons, we will pretend colour charges do not exist.
%   \footnote{Based on the experience with electromagnetism, and without
%     taking into account the measurement of $P$ and $C$ violation, one
%     might be tempted to also prescribe $P$ and $C$ invariance, which
%     would lead to the wrong EFT.}
%   % Interestingly, the weak interaction does not respect parity and
%   % charge conjugation invariance, an EFT based on these symmetries
%   % would fail.
% \item Finally, let us only keep the operators with the lowest mass
%   dimension (not counting kinetic and mass terms).
% \end{enumerate}

% The kinetic and mass terms for the fermions read
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   \lgr{} \supset \im  \bar{\psi}_i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i - m_i \bar{\psi}_i \psi_i \,.
%   \label{eq:foundations_Fermi_theory_kin}
% \end{equation}

% As before, we can calculate the mass dimension of all objects and find
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   [\psi] = \frac 3 2 \quad \text{and} \quad [\partial] = 1 \,.
% \end{equation}
% %
% Adding operators composed of two fermion fields will only give us more
% kinetic and mass terms and not change anything. Operators with three
% fermion fields violate both fermion number conservation and Lorentz
% invariance. So the lowest-dimensional operators that we can write down
% include four fermion fields and no derivatives:
% %
% \begin{align}
%   \lgr{} &\supset \frac {f_{1 \, ijkl} } {\Lambda^2}  \left( \bar{\psi}_i \psi_j \right) \left( \bar{\psi}_k \psi_l \right)
%                      + \frac {f_{2 \, ijkl} } {\Lambda^2}  \left( \bar{\psi}_i  \gamma_5 \psi_j \right) \left( \bar{\psi}_k \psi_l \right) \notag \\

% This is exactly Fermi theory, with $G_F = \sqrt{2} c / \Lambda^2 = 1.16 \cdot 10^{-5}$~GeV$^{-2}$.

\subsubsection{Why is the sky blue?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following Ref.~\cite{Kaplan:2005es}, we will demonstrate this
bottom-up approach with a simple question: why is the sky blue?
In other words, why is blue light coming from the sun scattered more
strongly by particles in the atmosphere than red light?  A full
derivation of this takes some time and requires knowledge of the
underlying electrodynamic interactions. Instead, we will write down an
effective field theory for this process of Rayleigh scattering. The
only thing we have to know are the basic scales of the process:
photons with energy $E_\gamma$ scatter off basically static nuclei
characterised by an excitation energy $\Delta E$, mass $M$ and radius
$a_0$. Looking at these numbers, we see that these scales are clearly
separated:
%
\begin{equation}
  E_\gamma \ll \Delta E,  a_0^{-1} \ll M \,.
\end{equation}
%
This is good news, since such a scale hierarchy is the basic
requirement for an EFT. We are interested in elastic scattering, so we
set the cutoff of the EFT as\footnote{In reality there are two orders
  of magnitude between $\Delta E$ and $a_0^{-1}$, but this does not
  affect the line of argument at all and we choose to ignore this
  fact.}
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda \sim \Delta E, a_0^{-1} \,.
\end{equation}

With this we can put together the building blocks for our EFT as
discussed above:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item As fields we will need photons and atoms, where we can
  approximate the latter as infinitely heavy.
  %
\item The relevant symmetries are the $U(1)_{em}$ and Lorentz
  invariance. At these energies we will also not be able to create or
  destroy atoms, which you can see as another symmetry requirement on
  the effective Lagrangian.
  %
\item We will include the lowest-dimensional operators that describe
  photon-atom scattering.
\end{enumerate}

The kinetic part of such an EFT reads
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{kin} = \phi_v^\dagger \im v^\alpha  \partial_\alpha \phi_v - \frac 1 4 F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\phi_v$ is the field operator representing an infinitely heavy
atom at constant velocity $v$, and $F_{\mu \nu}$ is the photon field
strength tensor. Boosting into the atom's rest frame, $v = (1,0,0,0)$
and the first term becomes the Lagrangian of the Schr\"odinger
equation.

The usual power counting based on $[\lgr{}]= 4$ gives the mass
dimensions
%
\begin{equation}
  [\partial] = 1 \,, \quad [v] = 0 \,, \quad [\phi] = \frac 3 2 \quad \text{and} \quad [F_{\mu \nu} ] = 2 \,.
\end{equation} 

The interaction operators must be Lorentz-invariant combinations of
$\phi^\dagger \phi$, $F_{\mu\nu}$, $v_\mu$, and $\partial_\mu$. Note
that operators directly involving $A_\mu$ instead of $F_{\mu \nu}$ are
forbidden by gauge invariance, and single instances of $\phi$
correspond to the creation or annihilation of atoms which is not
possible at these energies. The first such operators appear at mass
dimension 7,
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{int} = \frac {f_1} {\Lambda^3} \phi_v^\dagger \phi_v F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} 
  + \frac {f_2} {\Lambda^3} \phi_v^\dagger \phi_v v^\alpha F_{\alpha \mu} v_{\beta} F^{\beta \mu} 
  % + \frac {f_3} {\Lambda^3} \phi_v^\dagger \phi_v v^\alpha \partial_\alpha (F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu})
  + \ord{1/\Lambda^4} \,,
\end{equation}
%
and we expect them to contain the dominant effects of Rayleigh
scattering at energies $E_\gamma \ll \Lambda$.

The scattering amplitude of light off the atmospheric atoms should
therefore scale as $\mathcal{M} \sim 1 / \Lambda^3$, which means that
the cross section scales with $\sigma \sim 1 / \Lambda^6$. Since the
cross section has the dimension of an area, $[\sigma] = -2$, and the
only other mass scale in this low-energy process is the photon energy
$E_\gamma$, we know that the effective cross section must be
proportional to
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma \propto \frac {E_\gamma^4} {\Lambda^6} \left( 1 + \ord{E_\gamma / \Lambda} \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
In other words, blue light is much more strongly scattered than red
light. Our effective theory, built just from a few simple assumptions,
explains the colour of the sky!

Finally, we should check the validity range of our EFT. We expect it
to work as long as
%
\begin{equation}
  E_\gamma \ll \Lambda \sim \Delta E \sim \ord{\text{eV}}
\end{equation}
%
which is equivalent to wavelengths above $\ord{ 100 \ \text{nm}}$. Our
approximation is probably safe for visible light! In the near
ultraviolet we expect deviations from the $E_\gamma^4$ proportionality
and our EFT to break down.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Top-down approach and matching}
\label{sec:foundations_matching}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the top-down approach to effective field theories, we start from a
known model of UV physics and calculate the corresponding effective
operators and Wilson coefficients in the EFT. The defining criterion
of this \emph{matching procedure} is that at low energies the
effective and underlying descriptions agree, at least up to a given
order in the loop expansion (e.\,g.\ in $\alpha_s$) and up to a given
order in the EFT expansion in $1/\Lambda$.

This can be achieved either by functional methods or with Feynman
diagrams. Here we will sketch the conceptual foundation involving
functional methods, before arriving at a simple diagrammatic
method. Note that the matching cannot be reversed: one cannot uniquely
reconstruct a full theory only based on the EFT. Details of the
matching procedure will play a crucial role in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:validity}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{The effective action}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The central object that allows us to systematically analyse the
low-energy effects of heavy physics is the effective action
$\seff$. Following Ref.~\cite{Gaillard:1986dz, Henning:2014wua}, we
now outline its calculation at the one-loop level. Note that this is
just a conceptual sketch and not mathematically rigorous, and that we
omit higher-order terms irrelevant for this thesis as well as certain
cases of mixed loops with light and heavy
particles~\cite{Henning:2016lyp}. For a more thorough derivation see
the quantum field theory textbook of your choice.

For simplicity, let us assume that our theory $S[\phi, \Phi]$ consists
of light particles $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\Phi$ that should not be
part of the effective theory as dynamical degree of freedom. The
effective action is calculated by \emph{integrating out} the heavy
particles from the partition function,
%
\begin{equation}
  e^{\im \seff [\phi]} = \int \! \mathcal{D} \Phi \,  e^{\im S[\phi, \Phi]} \,.
  \label{eq:effective_action_definition}
\end{equation}
%
While the path integral over the heavy fields is computed, the light
fields are kept fixed as ``background fields''.

The effective action can be calculated with a saddle-point
approximation. For this we expand $\Phi$ around its classical value
$\Phi_c$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(x) = \Phi_c(x) + \eta(x) \,.
\end{equation}
%
$\Phi_c$ is defined by the classical equation of motion
%
\begin{equation}
  \left. \frac {\delta S[\phi,\Phi]} {\delta \Phi} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} = 0 \,,
  \label{eq:classical_eom}
\end{equation}
%
so expanding the action around this extremum leads to
%
\begin{equation}
  S[\phi, \Phi_c + \eta] = S[\phi,\Phi_c] + \frac 1 2 \left. \frac {\delta^2 S[\phi,\Phi]} {\delta \Phi^2} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} \eta^2 + \ord{\eta^3} \,.
\end{equation}
%
Plugging this into Eq.~\eqref{eq:effective_action_definition}, we find
%
\begin{equation}
  e^{\im \seff [\phi]} \approx e^{\im S[\phi,\Phi_c]} \, \int \! \mathcal{D} \eta \,  \exp \left( \frac 1 2 \left. \frac {\delta^2 S[\phi,\Phi]} {\delta \Phi^2} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} \eta^2 \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
The last term is a Gaussian integral with a known solution,
%
\begin{equation}
  e^{\im \seff [\phi]} \approx e^{\im S[\phi,\Phi_c]} \, \left[ \det \left( - \left. \frac {\delta^2 S} {\delta \Phi^2} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} \right) \right]^{-1/2} 
\end{equation}
%
and finally
%
\begin{equation}
  \seff [\phi] \approx S[\phi,\Phi_c] + \frac \im 2 \tr \log \left( - \left. \frac {\delta^2 S} {\delta \Phi^2} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} \right) \,,
  \label{eq:effective_action_result}
\end{equation}
%
where the functional trace is defined as an integral over momentum
space $k$ together with a sum over internal states $i$ such as spin or
flavour,
%
\begin{equation}
  \tr x \equiv \sum_{i} \intfourk \braket {k, i | x | k, i} \,.
  \label{eq:functional_trace}
\end{equation}
%
% \footnote{If we would have considered fermions instead, there would
% be a minus sign in front of the second term.}

This result can be directly evaluated with functional methods. The
first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:effective_action_result} can be easily
calculated by solving the classical equations of motions in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:classical_eom}. Computing the functional trace is more
involved, but can be simplified with a procedure called
\emph{covariant derivative expansion}~\cite{Gaillard:1985uh,
  Gaillard:1986dz}. Universal results that can be adapted to many
scenarios are available in the literature~\cite{Henning:2014wua,
  Drozd:2015rsp, Henning:2016lyp}.

The effective action is in general non-local, visible as (covariant)
derivatives $D$ appearing in the denominator (formally defined as
Green's functions). We expand these terms schematically as
%
\begin{equation}
    \phi^\dagger \frac 1 {D^2 - M^2} \phi = - \phi^\dagger \frac 1 {M^2}  \left[ 1 + \frac {D^2} {M^2} \right] \phi + \ord{1 / M^6}\,,
\end{equation}
%
so that only a rest term of higher order in $1/\Lambda = 1/M$ remains
non-local~\cite{Henning:2016lyp}. In a last step, we truncate the
resulting tower of operators at some order in our counting scheme, in
our case in the expansion in $1/\Lambda$. The resulting effective
theory consists of a finite set of local operators up to some order in
a counting scheme, compatible with our definition of effective
theories in the previous section. Unlike in the bottom-up approach,
not all operators have to appear, and we can calculate the Wilson
coefficients based on the underlying theory. 


  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Scalar example}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As a simple example consider a theory of two real scalar fields. The
light field $\phi$ has mass $m$, the heavy field $\Phi$ with mass $M$
will be integrated out. The underlying theory is given by
%
\begin{multline}
  S[\phi,\Phi] = \intfourx \Biggl[
    \frac 1 2 \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi
    - \frac {m^2} 2 \phi^2
    + \frac 1 2 \partial_\mu \Phi \partial^\mu \Phi
    - \frac {M^2} 2 \Phi^2 \\
    - \frac {\lambda_0} {4!} \phi^4
    - \frac {\lambda_2} {4} \phi^2 \Phi^2
    - \frac {\lambda_4} {4!} \Phi^4
    \Biggr] \,.
\end{multline}
%
Odd interactions and a mixing term $\phi\Phi$  are forbidden with suitable $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetries.

The classical equation of motion for $\Phi$ is
%
\begin{equation}
  \left( \partial^2 + M^2 + \frac {\lambda_2} 2 \phi^2 + \frac {\lambda_4} {3!} \Phi_c^2 \right) \Phi_c = 0
\end{equation}
%
with the trivial solution $\Phi_c = 0$.

The first term in the effective action then just gives back $\phi^4$
theory for the light field, without any new effective interactions:
%
\begin{equation}
  S[\phi,\Phi_c] = \intfourx \left[\frac 1 2 \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac {m^2} 2 \phi^2 - \frac {\lambda_0} {4!} \phi^4 \right] \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_scalar_example_effective_action_tree_part}
\end{equation}
%
The second term is
%
\begin{align}
  \frac \im 2 \tr \log \left( - \left. \frac {\delta^2 S} {\delta \Phi^2} \right|_{\Phi = \Phi_c} \right) 
  %
  &=  \frac \im 2  \tr \log \left( \partial^2 + M^2 + \frac {\lambda_2} 2 \phi^2 \right) \notag \\
  %
  &=  \frac \im 2  \tr \log \left( \partial^2 + M^2 \right) + \frac \im 2  \tr \log \left( 1 + \frac {\lambda_2} 2 \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 + \im \varepsilon} \phi^2 \right) \,,
  %
  % &=  \frac \im 2  \intfourk \braket {k| \log \left( \partial^2 + M^2 \right) | k} \notag \\
  % &\phantom{=} \quad + \frac \im 2  \intfourk \braket {k| \log \left( 1 + \frac {\lambda_2} 2 \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 + \im \varepsilon} \phi^2 \right) | k} \,.
\end{align}
%
where derivatives in the denominator are defined as Green's
functions. Since $\tr \log \left( \partial^2 + M^2 \right) $ is just a
constant that can be calculated for instance in dimensional
regularisation, the first part does not give us any higher-dimensional
operators of the light fields $\phi$. Expanding the logarithm in the
second term, we find
%
\begin{equation}
  \seff \supset \frac {\im \lambda_2} 4  \tr \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} \phi^2
  - \frac {\im \lambda_2^2} 8  \tr \left( \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} \phi^2 \right)^2
  + \frac {\im \lambda_2^3} {12}  \tr \left( \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} \phi^2\right)^3 
  + \ord{\lambda_2^4} \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_scalar_example_effective_action_powers}
\end{equation}
%
The first of these terms will renormalise the $\phi$ mass term, and
the second will contribute to the $\phi^4$ interaction. This is
important for RG running, but will not create the kind of new
effective interactions we are interested in here. We instead focus on
the last term and evaluate the functional trace:
%
\begin{align}
  \seff &\supset - \frac {\im \lambda_2^3} {12} \intfourk \braket {k| \left( \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} \phi^2 \right)^3 |k} \notag \\
  %
  &\supset - \frac {\im \lambda_2^3} {12} \;
    \intfourx \!\! \intfoury \!\! \intfourz \!\!
    \intfourk \!\! \intfourp \!\! \intfourq 
    \braket {k| \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} |x} \braket{x| \phi^2 |p}\notag \\
  &\phantom{\supset} \quad \quad
    \times \braket {p| \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} |y} \braket{y| \phi^2 |q} 
    \braket {q| \frac {1} {\partial^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} |z} \braket{z| \phi^2 |k} \,.
\end{align}
%
Here we have used the definition of the functional trace in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:functional_trace} and inserted unity,
$1 = \intfourx \ket{x} \bra{x} = \intfourp \ket{p} \bra{p}$.
$\ket{k}$, $\ket{p}$, and $\ket{q}$ are eigenstates of the derivative
operator $\partial$,
i.\,e.~$\bra{k} \im \partial_\mu = \bra{k} k_\mu$, while $\ket{x}$,
$\ket{y}$, and $\ket{z}$ denote the eigenstates of local operators,
$\bra{x} \phi^2= \bra{x} \phi^2(x)$. Their inner product is
$\braket {x|k} = e^{-\im k x}$. Using these properties and shifting
the integration variables, we get
%
\begin{align}
  \seff &\supset - \frac {\im \lambda_2^3} {12} \;
          \intfourx \!\! \intfoury \!\! \intfourz \!\!
          \intfourk \!\! \intfourp \!\! \intfourq
          \frac {1} {-k^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} e^{\im k x}  \phi(x)^2 e^{-\im p x} \notag \\
  &\phantom{\supset} \qquad
    \times \frac {1} {-p^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} e^{\im p y}  \phi(y)^2 e^{-\im (p+Q) y}  \;
    \frac {1} {-q^2 + M^2 - \im \varepsilon} e^{\im q z}  \phi(z)^2 e^{-\im k z} \notag \\
  %
  &\supset \frac {\im \lambda_2^3} {12} \;
    \intfourx \!\! \intfoury \!\! \intfourz \!\!
    \intfourk \!\! \intfourp \!\! \intfourq
    \phi(x)^2 \phi(y)^2 \phi(z)^2 \notag \\
  &\phantom{\supset} \qqquad 
    \times \frac {e^{\im p (z-x)} \, e^{\im q (z-y)}}
    { (k^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon) \, ((k+p)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon) \,  ((k+p+q)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon)} \,.
\end{align}

We can now perform the integral over the loop momentum $k$ with
Feynman parameters:
%
\begin{align}
  T_3(p,q)  &\equiv \intfourk \frac {1}
              { (k^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon) \,
              ((k+p)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon) \,
              ((k+p+q)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon)} \notag \\
  %
   &= 2 \int_0^1 \!\! \diff x \int_0^{1-x} \!\! \diff y \intfourk
     \Bigl[  x  (k^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon)
     + y ((k+p)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon) \notag \\
  &\phantom{=} \qqqquad \qqquad
    + (1-x -y)  ((k+p+q)^2 - M^2 + \im \varepsilon)  \Bigr]^{-3} \notag \\
  %
   &= 2 \int_0^1 \!\! \diff x \int_0^{1-x} \!\! \diff y \intfourk
     \frac 1 { \left[ (k + a)^2 - B  + \im \varepsilon \right]^3 }
\end{align}
%
with $a = (1 - x) p  + (1 - x - y) q $ and
$B = M^2 - (1 - x - y) (p+q)^2 - y p^2 + a^2$.
Shifting the loop momentum as $k \to k + a$, we finally arrive at
%
\begin{equation}
  T_3(p,q)  
   = 2 \int_0^1 \!\! \diff x \int_0^{1-x} \!\! \diff y \intfourk
     \frac 1 { \left[ k^2 - B + \im \varepsilon \right]^3 } \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_scalar_example_loop_function}
\end{equation}

To evaluate this, we first Wick-rotate $k^0 = \im k_E^0$. Formally,
this means shifting the integration path in the complex plane of $k^0$
from along the real axis to along the imaginary axis. The Cauchy
theorem assures that this does not change the value of the integral as
long as we chose the contour such that the poles are not caught
between the two contours. Defining
$k_E^2 = (k^0_E)^2 + \boldsymbol{k}^2 = - k^2$, we find
%
%\footnote{This
%  step requires $B>0$. In our case, $p$ and $q$ correspond to momenta
%  of the light fields, and in the validity regime of the EFT we should
%  always have $M^2 \gg p^2, q^2$ and therefore $B > 0$.}
%
\begin{equation}
  I_{0,3} 
   \equiv \intfourk \frac 1 { \left[ k^2 - B + \im \varepsilon \right]^3 } 
   = \im \intfourke \frac 1 { \left[ - k_E^2 - B \right]^3 } \,,
\end{equation}
%
where the $+ \im \varepsilon$ is no longer necessary. With
$\overbar{k} = |k_E |$ we can finally calculate the integral:
%
\begin{align}
  I_{0,3} = \frac {2 \pi^2} {(2 \pi)^4} \,
            \int \!\! \diff \overbar{k} {\overbar{k}}^3 \;
    \frac 1 { \left[ {\overbar{k}}^2 + B \right]^3 }
            = \frac {- \im } {32 \pi^2 B} \,.
\end{align}

Collecting all the pieces, we have
%
\begin{multline}
  \seff \supset \frac {\lambda_2^3} {192 \pi^2} \,
    \intfourx \!\! \intfoury \!\! \intfourz \phi(x)^2 \phi(y)^2 \phi(z)^2 
    \intfourp \!\! \intfourq e^{\im p (z-x)} \, e^{\im q (y-z)} \\
    \times \int_0^1 \!\! \diff x \int_0^{1-x} \!\! \diff y \;
    \left[ M^2 - (1 - x - y) (p+q)^2 - y p^2 + ((1-x) p  + (1 - x - y) q )^2 \right]^{-1} \,.
\end{multline}
%
At first glance, this is disappointing: this effective action looks
non-local and involves highly non-trivial integrals. It turns out that
these can in fact be calculated and give a finite
result~\cite{tHooft:1978jhc, Denner:1991kt}. \comment{Check
  discrepancy with Denner's habil!} The full expression is extremely
ugly. \comment{Just like the dear proof reader\dots} Fortunately, we
do not need it. Instead, we expand the integrand in powers of
$1/M^2$. We will only calculate the leading term at $\ord{1/M^2}$. We
will show that it produces a finite result as well, so the rest term
at $\ord{1/M^4}$ also has to be finite. Even more, we can argue that
the rest term at $\ord{1/M^4}$ has to vanish: the coefficient at a
given order $1/M^k$ in this expansion is an integral without any mass
scales, and has to lead to a result of mass dimension $k-2$. Only
$k = 2$ can give a non-zero and finite result, all higher orders
therefore have to vanish.
% Physically, this corresponds to approximating the loop momenta
% as lighter then the heavy mass scale, which makes sense in the
% validity region of the EFT.
\comment{Check this argument!} In this way, we find the much simpler
result
%
\begin{align}

%
After the expansion in $1/M$, we have finally arrived at a local
theory!

What about the higher terns in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_scalar_example_effective_action_powers}?
Their calculation is analogous to the one presented here and will lead
to operators like $\phi^8$ and higher. They will be suppressed at
least with $ 1 / M^4$ and are thus irrelevant for our dimension-six
effective theory.

Collecting the pieces in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_scalar_example_effective_action_tree_part}
and
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_scalar_example_effective_action_loop_part},
up to one loop and $\ord{1/M^2}$ the full effective action is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \seff[\phi] = \intfourx \left[\frac 1 2 \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi
    - \frac {m^2} 2 \phi^2 - \frac {\lambda_0} {4!} \phi^4
    + \frac {\lambda_2^3} {384 \pi^2 M^2 } \, \phi^6\right] \,.
\end{equation}
%
As expected, the dimension-6 operator is suppressed by two powers of
the heavy scale $\Lambda \equiv M$, and the Wilson coefficient
consists of the couplings $\lambda_2^3$ times a loop factor.

  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Diagrammatic matching}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As an alternative to this functional approach, the effective action in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:effective_action_result} can be calculated in an
intuitive diagrammatic way.  Since the light fields are kept fixed in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:effective_action_definition}, the effective action is
given by all connected Feynman diagrams with only $\phi$ as external
legs and only $\Phi$ fields as internal propagators. A more rigorous
derivation than the one in the precious section in fact reveals that
also certain connected loop diagrams with only $\phi$ as external legs
and both $\Phi$ and $\phi$ fields as internal propagators contribute
if they cannot be disconnected by cutting a single internal $\phi$
line~\cite{Henning:2016lyp}. The first term in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:effective_action_result} corresponds to all such
tree-level diagrams, the second term describes one-loop
pieces. Higher-loop corrections will play no role in this thesis and
were left out.

In practice, the effective operators and their Wilson coefficients can
be calculated without the need for any functional methods as follows:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with the particle content of the full model. Choose
  $\Lambda$ and divide the particles of the full model into light and
  heavy fields. Light fields, which should include at least those with
  masses below $\Lambda$, will make up the particle content of the
  effective theory. Heavy fields will be integrated out, that
  is, removed as dynamical degrees of freedom in the EFT.
%
\item Based on the particles and interactions of the full model, draw
  all connected Feynman diagrams in which
%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item all external legs are light fields, and
    \item that cannot be disconnected by cutting a single internal
      light field line. For tree-level diagrams this is equivalent to
      requiring that only heavy fields appear as internal lines.
  \end{itemize}
%
  Using the Feynman rules of the full model, calculate the expressions
  for these diagrams. Do not treat the external legs as incoming or
  outgoing particles, but keep the field operator expressions.
%
\item Express quantities of the full model in terms of
  $\Lambda$. Truncate this infinite series of diagrams at some order
  in $1/\Lambda$, depending on the dimension of the operators that you
  want to keep. Together with kinetic and mass terms for the light
  fields, these form the Lagrangian of the EFT.
\end{enumerate}



  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fermi theory again}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us apply this top-down procedure to our standard example of Fermi
theory. For simplicity, we do not take the full SM, but just the
interactions between massive $W$ bosons and fermions as the underlying
theory. The Lagrangian of these interactions is similar to that given
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_action_V_fermions}.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our full model consists of the quarks and leptons and the $W$
  boson. We want to analyse weak interactions below the $W$ mass, so
  we set $\Lambda = m_W$. So all quarks and leptons except for the top
  are the light particles of the EFT, while the $W$ boson and the top
  quark are heavy and have to be integrated out.
    %
\item The only diagram with the requested features that has only one
  heavy propagator has the form
  %
    \begin{equation}
      \raisebox{-0.5\height}{
       %\fbox{
        \fmfframe(0,10)(0,10){ %(L,T) (R,B)
          \begin{fmfgraph*}(70,50)
            \fmfleft{i2,i1}
            \fmfright{o2,o1}
            \fmflabel{\small $\psi_j$}{i1}
            \fmflabel{\small $\bar{\psi}_i$}{i2}
            \fmflabel{\small $\psi_l$}{o1}
            \fmflabel{\small $\bar{\psi}_k$}{o2}
            \fmf{fermion}{i1,v1,i2}
            \fmf{fermion}{o1,v2,o2}
            \fmf{dbl_wiggly,tension=1,label=$W$}{v1,v2}
            \marrow{m}{up}{top}{$p$}{v1,v2}
          \end{fmfgraph*}
        }
       %}
      }
    \end{equation}
    % 
    Double lines denote a heavy field. There are additional diagrams
    with $W$ self-interactions or $W$ loops, but they involve at least
    two $W$ propagators, which means that all contributions from them
    will be of order $\ord{1/\Lambda^4}$, which we will neglect.
  
    This diagram evaluates to
    % 
    \begin{align}
       &\quad  \left( \bar{\psi}_i \frac{\im g} {\sqrt{2}}  \frac {1 - \gamma_5} 2 \gamma^\mu \psi_j \right)  \frac {- g_{\mu \nu}} {p^2 - m_W^2}  \left( \bar{\psi}_k \frac{\im g} {\sqrt{2}} \frac {1 - \gamma_5} 2  \gamma^\nu \psi_l \right) \notag \\
      {} &= \frac { g^2 \left( \bar{\psi}_i (1 - \gamma_5) \gamma^\mu \psi_j \right)  \left( \bar{\psi}_k (1 - \gamma_5)  \gamma_\mu \psi_l \right) }  {8 (p^2 - m_W^2)}
    \end{align}
    %
  \item The only dimensionful parameter is $m_W = \Lambda$, and for
    the EFT to be valid we assume $p^2 \ll \Lambda^2$. We can then
    expand this expression as
    %
    \begin{equation}
       \frac { g^2 } {8 m_W^2}  \left( \bar{\psi}_i (1 - \gamma_5) \gamma^\mu \psi_j \right)  \left( \bar{\psi}_k (1 - \gamma_5)  \gamma_\mu \psi_l \right) + \ord{1 / \Lambda^4} \,.
    \end{equation}
    %
    With this, we again rediscover the dimension-6 EFT matched to the
    weak interactions of the SM:
    %
   \begin{equation}
     \lgr{} =  \im  \bar{\psi}_i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_i - m_i \bar{\psi}_i \psi_i 
     + \frac {c } {\Lambda^2}  \left( \bar{\psi}_i  (1 - \gamma_5) \gamma_\mu \psi_j \right) \left( \bar{\psi}_k (1 - \gamma_5) \gamma^\mu \psi_l \right) \,.
     \label{eq:foundations_fermi_theory}
   \end{equation}
   %
   with heavy scale $\Lambda = m_W$ and Wilson coefficient
   $c = g^2 / 8$. Replacing $c / \Lambda^2$ by
   $G_F / \sqrt{2} = g^2 / (8 m_W^2)$ restores the historic form of
   Fermi theory.
\end{enumerate}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Operator mixing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So far we have neglected that like all parameters in a QFT, the Wilson
coefficients of an EFT depend on the energy scale. Running the model
from one energy to a different one leads to \emph{operator mixing}:
loop effects from one operator will affect the coefficients of other
operators. If the Wilson coefficients are given at the matching scale
$\Lambda$ (we use this symbol since the matching scale is usually
chosen only slightly below the EFT cutoff), at the scale of interest
$E$ they will take on values of the form
%
\begin{equation}
  f_i (E) \sim f_i(\Lambda) \pm \sum_j \frac {g^2} {16 \pi^2} \, \log \frac {\Lambda^2} {E^2} \,f_j(\Lambda) \,,
  \label{eq:foundations_EFT_running}
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ are the typical couplings in the loops.

If the matching scale is not too far away from the energy scale of
interest and if all Wilson coefficients are already sizeable at the
matching scale, this is often negligible. There is an important
consequence, though: even if an operator is zero at the matching
scale, operator mixing will give it a small but non-zero value at
lower energies. So regardless of what the underlying model is, it can
be expected that eventually all effective operators allowed by the
symmetries will receive contributions from it. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Dimension-six Higgs physics}
\label{sec:foundations_higgs_eft}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We now apply these general ideas to electroweak and in particular
Higgs physics at the TeV scale and construct the Standard Model
effective field theory (interchangeably called linear Higgs effective
field theory) up to dimension six. This is the framework we will use
throughout this thesis. We will first argue why such an effective
theory is very useful, and then construct its effective operators
following the recipe laid out in
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_eft_bottom_up}. Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_pheno}
will take a closer look at the phenomenology of these
operators. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_alternatives}
we briefly discuss a few alternative frameworks.

\newparagraph
%
As argued in Section~\ref{sec:foundations_relevance}, there are many
reasons to suspect new physics in the Higgs sector. Some of these
arguments, such as the hierarchy problem or the WIMP miracle of dark
matter, point towards BSM physics close to the electroweak scale or,
depending on the level of acceptable fine-tuning, up to a few
TeV. Unfortunately these (purely aesthetic) arguments do not tell us
how exactly such physics should look like.

This leaves us with a question highly relevant for upcoming ATLAS and
CMS analyses: what is the best language to discuss indirect signs of
new physics at the electroweak scale, in particular in the Higgs
sector?

Directly interpreting measurements in complete models of new physics
is impractical: for $n_y \gg 1$ signatures and $m_a \gg 1$ models this
requires $m_a n_y$ limits to be derived.\footnote{The weird notation
  is necessary because the author cannot resist a stupid pun.} Also,
the parameter space of such models (think of the relatively simple
MSSM) can be huge, and many of their features do not matter at the
electroweak scale at all. It makes more sense to define an
intermediate framework that can be linked both to measurements and to
full theories, so only $n_y$ sets of limits plus $m_a$ translation
rules from complete theories to the intermediate language have to be
calculated. Such a framework should include all necessary physics, but
no phenomena irrelevant at this scale\dots exactly the defining
feature of an effective field theory.

\subsection{Operators}
\label{sec:foundations_heft_operators}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Building blocks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since we do not know what physics lays beyond the SM, we have to
construct our EFT from a bottom-up perspective. As discussed above,
this means we have to write down all operators based on a set of
particles that are compatible with certain symmetries and are
important according to some counting scheme. Let us go through these
one by one:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item As degrees of freedoms we use the SM fields. In particular, we
  assume the Higgs boson $h$ and the Goldstone bosons $w_i$ are
  combined in a $SU(2)_L$ doublet $\phi$ as in the SM, see
  Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_sm_phi}. This is consistent with correct
  data and the correct choice if new physics decouples, that is, if in
  the limit $\Lambda \to \infty$ the SM is
  recovered~\cite{Krause:2016uhw}. We will discuss an alternative
  construction based on the physical scalar $h$ instead of $\phi$ as
  the fundamental building block in
  Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_alternatives}.
  %
\item All operators have to be invariant under Lorentz transformations
  and under the SM gauge group $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$,
  and conserve lepton and baryon number.
  %
\item We order the operators by their mass dimension and thus their
  suppression in powers of $1/\Lambda$. We will keep those up to mass
  dimension 6, i.\,e.~$\ord{1/\Lambda^2}$.
\end{enumerate}

Simple dimensional analysis of the kinetic terms of the SM fields
tells us the mass dimensions of all building blocks:
%
\begin{equation}
  [f] = \frac 3 2\,, \quad [V_\mu] = 1 \,, \quad [V_{\mu \nu}] = 2 \,, \quad
  [\phi] = 1 \,, \quad [\partial_\mu] = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad [D_\mu] = 1 \,.
\end{equation}

The only dimension-five operator that can be built from the SM fields
is the Weinberg operator
$(\overbar{L}_L \tilde{\phi}* )(\tilde{\phi}^\dagger L_L)$. It
generates a Majorana mass term for the neutrinos and violates lepton
number, and is entirely irrelevant for Higgs physics. The leading
effects in our EFT are expected to come from dimension-6 operators:
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{EFT} = \lgr{SM} + \sum_i \frac {f_i} {\Lambda^2} \ope{i} + \ord{1/\Lambda^4}
  \label{eq:sm_eft}
\end{equation}
%
with unknown cutoff scale $\Lambda$ and Wilson coefficients $f_i$. For
convenience, we will from now on drop the higher-order terms.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:foundations_eft_bottom_up}, field
redefinitions (or, relatedly, equations of motions), Fierz identities
and integration by parts provide equivalence relations between certain
operators and give us some freedom to define a basis of
operators. Taking these into account, there are 59 independent types
of dimension-six operators, not counting flavour structures and
Hermitian conjugation~\cite{Grzadkowski:2010es}. Counting all possible
flavour structures, there are 2499 distinct operators. Fortunately, in
practice only a small subset of these are relevant: first, the strong
constraints on flavour-changing neutral currents motivates the
assumption of flavour-diagonal or even flavour-universal Wilson
coefficients. Second, only a small number of these operators directly
affects Higgs physics. At higher orders in the EFT expansion, the
number of operators increases rapidly, explaining why we stick to the
leading effects at dimension 6: not counting flavour structures, there
are $\ord{1000}$ operators at dimension 8 and $\ord{10\,000}$
dimension-10 operators~\cite{Henning:2015alf}.

Three different conventions have become popular: in addition to the
complete ``Warsaw'' basis~\cite{Grzadkowski:2010es}, there is the SILH
convention~\cite{Giudice:2007fh} and the HISZ
basis~\cite{Hagiwara:1993ck}. For a comparison of and conversion
between these bases see Refs.~\cite{Falkowski:2015wza,
  Brehmer:2015rna}\comment{More references?}. Throughout this thesis
we use the basis developed in~Refs.~\cite{Corbett:2012ja,
  Corbett_thesis}, which is strongly based on the HISZ basis and now
widely used in global fits~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa, Butter:2016cvz}.

We classify the operators based on their field content and on their
behaviour under $CP$ transformations. This combined charge conjugation
and parity inversion is an approximate symmetry of the SM that is only
violated by the complex phase of the CKM matrix. In addition, there
are rather tight bounds on $CP$ violation in many processes. This
motivates many analyses to restrict their set of operators to the
$CP$-conserving ones. On the other hand, new sources of $CP$ violation
are needed to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe,
and their effects at low energies could be visible as $CP$-violating
effective operators. Both types of operators will be analysed in this
thesis.

\end{table}

We begin with the $CP$-conserving dimension-six operators relevant for
Higgs physics, following Refs.~\cite{Corbett:2012ja, Corbett_thesis}.
In Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_bosonic_even} we list the
bosonic ones, Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_fermionic_even}
gives the Higgs-fermion operators, and the ``dipole operators'' made
of Higgs fields, gauge bosons, and fermions are listed in
Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_dipole}. We use the convention
for the sign in the covariant derivative given in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_covariant_derivative}, $T^a$ are the $SU(3)$
generators, and
%
\begin{equation}
  \phi^\dagger \overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu \phi \equiv \phi^\dagger D_\mu \phi - (D_\mu \phi)^\dagger \phi
 \quad \text{and} \quad 
  \phi^\dagger \overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu^a \phi \equiv \phi^\dagger \sigma^a D_\mu \phi - (D_\mu \phi)^\dagger \sigma^a \phi \,.
\end{equation}

% These operators can be separated into two groups: first, since
% $\phi^\dagger \phi$ is a scalar gauge singlet, it can be attached it
% to any dimension-4 operator of the SM to form a dimension-6
% operator. Second, additional (covariant) derivatives allow for new
% structures very different from the SM vertices.

  \label{eq:foundations_dual_field_strengths}
\end{equation}

Finally, there are a few pure $CP$-even and $CP$-odd pure gauge
operators made from field strength tensors and (covariant)
derivatives, and a large number of four-fermion operators similar to
the one in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_fermi_theory}, which will not be
important in this thesis.

% For the sake of completeness, we finally list the operators not
% containing Higgs fields as well, following Refs.~\ref{Corbett_thesis,
%   Grzadkowski:2010es}. Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_pure_gauge}
% shows the operators made from gauge fields and covariant derivatives, where
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   (D^\mu W_{\mu\nu})^a \equiv \partial^\mu W^a_{\mu\nu} - g \varepsilon^{abc} W^b_\mu W^c_\nu \,, \quad
%   (D^\mu G_{\mu\nu})^a \equiv \partial^\mu G^a_{\mu\nu} - g_s f^{abc} G^b_\mu G^c_\nu \,.
% \end{equation}
% %
% Finally, Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_four_fermion} offers a
% glimpse into the vast world of four-fermion operators. 

As argued above, not all of these operators are independent.  The
equations of motions for the Higgs field and the electroweak gauge
bosons read~\cite{Grzadkowski:2010es}
%
\begin{align}
  D^2 \phi &= - \mu^2 \phi - 2 \lambda (\phisq) \phi - \sum_f y_f \overbar{f}_R f_L + \ord{1/\Lambda^2} \,, \\
  % (D^\rho G_{\rho \mu})^a &= g_s \left( \overbar{q}_L \gamma_\mu T^a q_L + \overbar{u}_R \gamma_\mu T^a u_R + \overbar{d}_R \gamma_\mu T^a d_R  + \ord{1/\Lambda^2} \,,   \\
  \partial^\rho B_{\rho \mu} &= - \frac {g'} 2 \left( \im  \phi^\dagger \overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu \phi + \sum_f Y_f \overbar{f} \gamma_\mu f \right) + \ord{1/\Lambda^2} \,, \\
  (D^\rho W_{\rho \mu})^a &= \frac g 2 \left( \im \phi^\dagger \overleftrightarrow{D}_\mu^a \phi + \overbar{q}_L \gamma_\mu \sigma^a q_L + \overbar{\ell}_L \gamma_\mu \sigma^a \ell_L  \right) + \ord{1/\Lambda^2} \,, 
\end{align}
%
where $Y_f$ are the weak hypercharges of the fermions.  Following
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_field_redefinitions}, this provides us with
three equivalence relations between dimension-six
operators~\cite{Corbett:2012ja, Corbett_thesis}:
%
\begin{align}
  \ope{\phi,2} + \ope{\phi,4} - \mu^2 (\phisq)^2 - 6 \lambda \ope{6} &= \sum_f y_f \ope{f} + \ord{1/\Lambda^4}\\
  2 \ope{B} + \ope{BW} + \ope{BB} + g'^2 \left( \ope{\phi,1} - \frac 1 2 \ope{\phi,2} \right) &= - \frac {g'^2} 2 \sum_f Y_f \ope{\phi f}^{(1)} + \ord{1/\Lambda^4}\\
  2 \ope{W} + \ope{BW} + \ope{WW} + g^2 \left( \ope{\phi,4} - \frac 1 2 \ope{\phi,2} \right) &= - \frac {g^2} 4 \left( \ope{\phi L}^{(3)} +  \ope{\phi Q}^{(3)} \right) + \ord{1/\Lambda^4}\,.
\end{align}
%
This lets us eliminate three of the operators listed in
Tables~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_bosonic_even} to
\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_bosonic_odd}.

There are different strategies for picking the operators to keep. In a
top-down approach, one could choose operators based on the underlying
physics. In a bottom-up approach, calculations can be simplified if
the operators are chosen based on their contributions to physical
observables, for instance to avoid blind directions. Applied to Higgs
physics, this logic suggests to discard $\ope{\phi L}^{(1)}$,
$\ope{(3)}$, and $\ope{\phi,4}$~\cite{Corbett:2012ja}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some of the remaining operators are tightly constrained experimental
data. Electroweak precision measurements limit the Wilson coefficients
of $\ope{\phi,1}$, $\ope{BW}$, $\ope{\phi f}^{(1)}$,
$\ope{\phi f}^{(3)}$, $\ope{B\widetilde{W}}$, and
$\ope{\widetilde{B}}$ to a level where their effects in Higgs physics
are small. Measurements of electric dipole moments put tight constrains
on the dipole operators. We will ignore all these
operators.\footnote{This simple argument is suitable for our rather
  conceptual work. In a thorough global fit, however, it should be
  checked carefully whether these constraints are actually strong
  enough to make all these operator irrelevant for Higgs physics in
  all cases. Such a check should include RGE effects when comparing
  constraints from different scales. The increasing precision in Higgs
  observables means that many of these operators will become relevant
  again in the future.}

Limits on flavour-changing neutral currents constrain
off-diagonal fermion-Higgs couplings. Also, flavour-diagonal $\ope{f}$
involving fermions of the first and second generation will be
irrelevant for many signatures considered in this thesis. We therefore
only keep the Higgs-fermion operators $\ope{f}$ of the third
generation.

This leaves us with a list of thirteen operators relevant for LHC
Higgs physics: ten $CP$-even operators,
%
\begin{equation}
  \ope{\phi,2} \,, \quad 
  \ope{\phi,3} \,, \quad 
  \ope{GG} \,, \quad 
  \ope{BB} \,, \quad 
  \ope{WW} \,, \quad 
  \ope{B} \,, \quad 
  \ope{W} \,, \quad 
  \ope{\tau} \,, \quad
  \ope{t} \,, \quad  \text{and} \quad
  \ope{b} \,;
  \label{eq:foundations_operators_even}
\end{equation}
%
and three $CP$-odd ones,
%
\begin{equation}
  \ope{G\widetilde{G}} \,, \quad 
  \ope{B\widetilde{B}} \,, \quad  \text{and} \quad
  \ope{W\widetilde{W}} \,. 
  \label{eq:foundations_operators_odd}
\end{equation}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Renormalisation group evolution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Wilson coefficients of these operators depend on the energy scale.
In the last years, the contributions of all dimension-six operators on
the running of the SM parameters, as well as the whole $59\times 59$
anomalous dimension matrix of dimension-six operators, have been
calculated at one-loop level~\cite{Jenkins:2013zja, Jenkins:2013wua,
  Alonso:2013hga}. This provides all necessary tools to run the EFT
parameters from the matching scale $\Lambda$ to the experimental scale
$E$. Following Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_EFT_running}, this shifts the
Wilson coefficients by a term proportional to a loop factor and
$\log \Lambda^2 / E^2$.

As we will discuss in some length in Chapter~\ref{chapter:validity},
the LHC Higgs measurements are only sensitive to new physics scales
between the electroweak scale and the TeV scale. The corresponding
logarithm typically cannot compensate for the loop factor, and the RGE
effects on Wilson coefficients that are already non-zero at the
matching scale are small. We will therefore neglect operator running
for our analyses.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Phenomenology}
\label{sec:foundations_heft_pheno}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After picking a set of operators, the next question is how they affect
Higgs observables. We will first discuss two examples, $\ope{\phi,2}$
and $\ope{W}$, in detail, before listing the effects of all operators
in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:foundations_operators_even} and
\eqref{eq:foundations_operators_even}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{$\ope{\phi2}$: rescaled Higgs couplings}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our first example is the operator $\ope{\phi,2}$. Ignoring the
Goldstones, it consists only of derivatives and Higgs fields
$\phisq = (v^2 + 2 v \tilde{h} + \tilde{h}^2) / 2$, where we use a
tilde on $h$ for reasons that will become clear soon. Its contribution
to the Lagrangian reads
%
\begin{align}
  \lgr{EFT} &\supset \frac {f_{\phi, 2}} {2\Lambda^2} \, \partial^\mu(\phi^\dagger\phi) \, \partial_\mu(\phi^\dagger\phi) \notag \\
  %{} &= \frac {f_{\phi, 2}} {2\Lambda^2} \, \frac {( 2 v \partial_\mu \tilde{h} + 2 \tilde{h} \partial_\mu \tilde{h} )^2} 4  \notag \\
  {} &= \frac {f_{\phi, 2} v^2} {2\Lambda^2} \, \partial_\mu \tilde{h} \partial^\mu \tilde{h} + \frac {f_{\phi, 2} \, v} {\Lambda^2} \, \tilde{h} \partial_\mu \tilde{h} \partial^\mu \tilde{h} + \frac {f_{\phi, 2} \, v} {2 \Lambda^2} \, \tilde{h}^2 \partial_\mu \tilde{h} \partial^\mu \tilde{h} \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_ophi2_terms}
\end{align}
%
The first term rescales the kinetic term of the Higgs boson:
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{EFT} \supset \left( 1 + \frac {f_{\phi 2} v^2} {\Lambda^2} \right) \, \frac 1 2 \, \partial_\mu \tilde{h} \partial^\mu \tilde{h} \,.
\end{equation}

To restore the canonical form of the kinetic term, we have to rescale
the Higgs boson $\tilde{h}$ to
%
\begin{equation}
  h = \sqrt{1 + \frac {f_{\phi 2} v^2} {\Lambda^2} } \, \tilde{h} \,.
  \label{eq:foundations_ophi2_rescaling}
\end{equation}
%
On the one hand, this universally shifts all Higgs couplings to other
particles as
%
\begin{equation}
  g_{hxx} = \frac 1 {\sqrt{1 + \frac {f_{\phi 2} v^2} {\Lambda^2} } }  \, g_{hxx}^{\text{SM}}\,. 
\end{equation}

The effect on the Higgs self-coupling is more involved. First, the
rescaling in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_ophi2_rescaling} also affects
the Higgs mass term given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_higgs_mass_sm}. For fixed $v$ and $m_h$, this amounts to shifting the Higgs
self-coupling $\lambda$ to
%
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \frac {m_h^2} {2 v^2} \, \left( 1 + \frac {f_{\phi 2} v^2} {\Lambda^2} \right) \,.
\end{equation}
%
In addition, the second term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_ophi2_terms}
introduces a new Lorentz structure into the Higgs self-interaction
that depends on the Higgs momenta. A non-zero Wilson coefficients
$f_{\phi 2}$ will therefore have a strong impact on Higgs pair
production, not only on the total rate, but also on kinematic
distributions.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{$\ope{W}$: new Higgs-gauge structures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our second example is $\ope{W}$, which contracts covariant derivatives
acting on Higgs doublets, defined in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_covariant_derivative}, with a field strength
tensor
$W_{\mu\nu}^k = \partial_\mu W^k_\nu - \partial_\nu W^k_\mu + g
\varepsilon^{kmn} W^m_\mu W^n_\nu$.
Expanding $\ope{W}$ and only keeping the pieces that will affect the
$hWW$ coupling, we find
%
\begin{align}
  \lgr{EFT} &\supset \frac {f_{W}} {\Lambda^2} \, \frac{\im g}{2} \, (D^\mu\phi)^\dagger \sigma^k ( D^\nu\phi) \, W_{\mu\nu}^k \notag \\
  {} &= \frac {\im g f_{W}} {2 \Lambda^2} 
       \left(\partial^\mu \phi^\dagger + \frac {\im  g} 2 W^{m\,\mu} \phi^\dagger \sigma^m + \frac {\im  g'} 2 B^\mu \phi^\dagger \right) \sigma^k \left(\partial^\nu \phi - \frac {\im g} 2 \sigma^n  W^{n\,\nu} \phi - \frac {\im  g'} 2 B^\nu \phi\right) W_{\mu\nu}^k \notag \\
  {} &\supset \frac {\im g f_{W}} {2 \Lambda^2}  \, \Biggl\{
       \frac {\partial^\mu h} {\sqrt 2} \, \left[ \sigma^k  \sigma^n \right]_{22} \, \frac {-\im g} 2 \, W^{n \,\nu} \, \frac v {\sqrt{2}} %\notag \\
   % &\phantom{=} \quad  \quad \quad \quad 
+ \frac {\im g} 2 \, W^{m \,\nu} \, \frac v {\sqrt{2}}  \, \left[ \sigma^m  \sigma^k \right]_{22} \, \frac {\partial^\mu h} {\sqrt 2}
       \Biggr\} \, W_{\mu\nu}^k \notag \\
  {} &= \frac {f_{W}} {\Lambda^2} \, \frac{g^2 v}{8} \,  \left[ \sigma^k,  \sigma^n \right]_{22} \, (\partial^\mu h)  \, W^{n \,\nu}  \, W_{\mu\nu}^k \notag \\
  %{} &= \frac {f_{W}} {\Lambda^2} \, \frac{g^2 v}{8} \,  2 \im \varepsilon^{knm} \, \sigma^m_{22} \, (\partial^\mu h)  \, W^{n \,\nu}  \, W_{\mu\nu}^k\notag \\
  {} &= \frac {f_{W}} {\Lambda^2} \, \frac{\im g^2 v}{4} \, \varepsilon^{nk3} \, (\partial^\mu h)  \,  W^{n \,\nu}  \, W_{\mu\nu}^k  \,.
\end{align}
%
With $m_W = gv / 2$ and
$W^\pm_\mu = (W^1_\mu \mp \im W^2_\mu ) / \sqrt{2}$ this finally
fields
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{EFT} \supset \frac {f_{W}} {\Lambda^2} \, \frac{\im gm_W}{2} \, (\partial^\mu h) \left( W^{+ \,\nu} \, W^-_{\mu\nu} + W^{- \,\nu} \, W^+_{\mu\nu} \right) \,.
\end{equation}

This is another contribution to the $hWW$ vertex. But unlike the SM-like coupling
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{SM} \supset g m_W \, h W^{+ \,\mu} \, W^-_{\mu} \,,
\end{equation}
%
the $\ope{W}$ term includes derivatives. This means that the
interaction gains a momentum dependence:
%
\begin{equation}
  \raisebox{-0.475\height}{
      \fmfframe(10,15)(10,15){ %(L,T) (R,B)
        \begin{fmfgraph*}(60,60)

      }
  }
  =  \im g m_W  
  \left[ g_{\mu \nu} +  \frac{f_W}{2 \Lambda^2} \, p_H^2 \, g_{\mu \nu} + \frac{f_W}{2 \Lambda^2} \left( p^H_\mu p^+_\nu + p^-_\mu p^H_\nu \right) \right] \, ,
  \label{eq:foundations_OW_HWW_Feynman_rule}
\end{equation}
%
where $p^\pm_\mu$ and $p^H_\mu$ are the incoming momenta of the
$W^\pm$ and the $H$, respectively.

  \caption[Momentum dependence from $\ope{W}$ in $Zh$
  production]{Distribution of the $Zh$ invariant mass in the
    Higgs-strahlung process $pp \to Zh$ at LHC conditions. We compare
    the contributions from the SM, the operator $\ope{W}$ squared, and
    their interference, which can be constructive (left) or
    destructive (right).}
    % Note that this plot is based on a different
    % operator basis, which is why the operator $\ope{W}$ used in this
    % plot is closely related, but not identical to that defined in
    % Table~\ref{tbl:foundations_operators_bosonic_even}.
  \label{fig:foundations_OW_Zh_demo}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

This operator illustrates two key features of the EFT approach. First,
$\ope{W}$ does not only affect the $hWW$ vertex, but also $hZZ$
interactions and triple-gauge couplings such as $WWZ$. This means that
the dimension-6 operator language allows us to combine different
measurements in a global fit.

Second, $\ope{W}$ changes the shape of distributions, for instance in
Higgs-strahlung at the LHC,
%
\begin{equation}
  p p \to Z h \,.
\end{equation}
%
In this process, the intermediate $Z$ can carry arbitrary large energy
and momentum, which we can measure for instance as the invariant mass
of the final $Zh$ system. From
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_OW_HWW_Feynman_rule} we expect that the
effects from $\ope{W}$ will grow with $m_{Zh}$. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:foundations_OW_Zh_demo} we demonstrate this by comparing the
distribution of $m_{Zh}$ based on only the SM couplings, on the
dimension-6 operator $\ope{W}$ only, and on the interference between
the two components. Indeed we see that $\ope{W}$ contributes mostly in
the high-energy tail of the distribution. 




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{All those couplings}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After these two worked-out examples, we now give the complete list of
single-Higgs couplings induced by the dimension-six operators of
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:foundations_operators_even} and
\eqref{eq:foundations_operators_odd}, some of which were calculated in
Refs.~\cite{Corbett:2012ja, Corbett_thesis} and cross-checked by us.

\comment{Check $CP$-odd ones.}

Here $s \equiv g' / \sqrt{g^2 + g'^2}$ and $c = \sqrt{1 - s^2}$ are
the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle, and
$V_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu V_\nu - \partial_\nu V_\mu$ for
$V = A, W^\pm, Z$.

Note that the clear majority of the couplings in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:foundations_higgs_interactions} does not exist in the SM
and contains derivatives. Dimension-six operators predict a variety of
novel kinematic features in Higgs interactions, making their
measurement at the LHC both exciting and challenging.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Alternative frameworks}
\label{sec:foundations_heft_alternatives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The linear Higgs EFT discussed above is not the only useful
parametrisation of Higgs properties. We will briefly go through some
of the alternative frameworks and explain their main properties,
before finishing this chapter with a comparison of the different
approaches.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{$\kappa$ framework}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

During run~1 of the LHC, the most widely used parametrisation of the
Higgs properties was the $\kappa$
framework~\cite{LHCHiggsCrossSectionWorkingGroup:2012nn} or the
closely related $\Delta$ framework~\cite{Lafaye:2009vr}. Its
construction is remarkably simple: starting from the SM Higgs sector,
all Higgs couplings are dressed with form factors,
%
\begin{equation}
  g_{hxx} = \kappa_x g_{hxx}^{\text{SM}} \,.
\end{equation}

Some care has to be taken to treat the Higgs-gluon and Higgs-photon
couplings consistently, where indirect effects of shifted Higgs-top or
Higgs-$W$ couplings compete with direct effects from new
physics~\cite{Lafaye:2009vr}.

From a theoretical point of view, the $\kappa$ framework is not
gauge-invariant and does not present a consistent quantum field
theory. In practice, this means that electroweak loop effects may
introduce divergences that cannot be renormalised.~\comment{Citation?}
This problem can be solved by embedding the $\kappa$ framework in a UV
completion~\cite{Lopez-Val:2013yba}.

From a more phenomenological point of view, this approach is well
suited to parametrise measurements of total rates. Simple shifts of
SM-like Higgs coupling structures are expected in some scenarios of
new physics, for instance in many scalar extensions of the Higgs
sector~\cite{Lopez-Val:2013yba}. But many other models predict new
kinematic features, visible as changed kinematic shapes, and the
$\kappa$ framework is unable to describe these. For better or worse,
it is also agnostic about correlations between different Higgs
couplings, and about correlations between Higgs observables and triple
gauge vertices or electroweak precision measurements.

The strength of the $\kappa$ framework is clearly not its theoretical
foundation. Its allure comes from its simplicity and the fact that it
is designed around the simple question of measuring the couplings of
the (SM-like) Higgs boson. This parametrisation made sense as a
common denominator for the first Higgs measurements with limited
statistics of run~1 of the LHC. But the increased amount of data and
crucial kinematic information collected during run~2 require a
different, more sophisticated language.

\subsubsection{Pseudo-Observables}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Higgs pseudo-observables (POs)~\cite{Isidori:2013cga, Bordone:2015nqa,
  Greljo:2015sla} are designed as a generalisation of the $\kappa$
framework to include BSM kinematic features. In a very broad sense,
this term encompasses any number that is field theoretically defined
and can be experimentally accessed~\cite{Krause:2016uhw}. Signal
strengths, cross sections, partial widths, total widths, and
individual form factors or couplings all fall under this umbrella
term. Here we follow the more narrow definition of effective-coupling
PO~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. Pseudo-observables are then constructed
process by process by writing down all contributing amplitudes under
some broad assumptions on new physics. These expressions are then
decomposed in a pole expansion, and the resulting residues are
identified as pseudo-observables. This procedure also requires an
expansion in the inverse of the new physics scale $\Lambda$. This
means that just as the EFT approach, pseudo-observables rely on new
physics being heavy, $E \ll \Lambda$. So far, this framework has been
developed for Higgs production in WBF or Higgs-strahlung, as well as
for all phenomenologically relevant Higgs decays.

Phenomenologically, pseudo-observables can describe shifts in SM
couplings as well as kinematic shapes. Like the EFT approach, their
construction requires certain minimal assumptions on the symmetries of
new physics as well as an expansion in $1/\Lambda$. In fact, at tree
level pseudo-observables can be mapped linearly to an EFT constructed
with the same ingredients (which is the non-linear Higgs EFT discussed
below).

The main difference between pseudo-observables and the EFT approach is
a conceptual one. Pseudo-observables are designed from the perspective
of a given process: they describe the coefficients of the different
contributing amplitudes. They are not parameters of a Lagrangian and
do not define a consistent quantum field theory. In particular, the
values of POs measured in one process have no meaning for other
processes. Effective operators on the other hand are a proper,
gauge-invariant quantum field theory that universally describes any
physics below the cutoff scale, and the same Wilson coefficients
predict the behaviour of very different processes.

Proponents of the PO approach favour a multi-layer interpretation of
LHC data, where the data is first presented in terms
pseudo-observables, which can then be interpreted in terms of EFTs or
specific models of UV physics. They argue that this approach provides
a clear separation between measurement and
interpretation~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. On the other hand, proponents
of the ``direct EFT approach'' argue that there is no need for such an
intermediate layer, and suggest to directly fit effective
operators. The debate about which approach is better is still
ongoing~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. Ultimately, both effective operators
and POs are well-defined frameworks that can describe all relevant
kinematic effects, and thus present a suitable interface between
experiment and theory.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Non-linear Higgs effective field theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The SM EFT (or linear Higgs EFT) constructed in
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_operators} is not the only effective
field theory that can describe Higgs physics. It is based on the
choice to construct operators from the scalar doublet $\phi$ that
combines the physical Higgs boson and the Goldstones. Alternatively,
we can separate the physical scalar $h$ from the Goldstones $w_a$ and
include both independently. Together with new power-counting rules
which we will discuss later, this defines the non-linear Higgs EFT.  It
is alternatively simply called ``Higgs EFT'' or ``chiral Higgs EFT''.

As this last name hints, this theory has a structure similar to that
of chiral perturbation theory, for an introduction see for instance
Ref.~\cite{HillerBlin:2016jpb}. The Goldstone bosons $w_a$, no longer
a part of a Higgs doublet, can be organised in the exponential form
%
\begin{equation}
  U = e^{\im \sigma_a w_a} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The Goldstones transform non-linearly under the (approximate) global
custodial symmetry $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$, giving the EFT its name.

The leading-order Lagrangian is then given by

% \label{sec:foundations_heft_matching}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% A proper discussion of the other perspective to Higgs EFT, the matching of complete models of new physics to the dimension-6 operators, is beyond the scope of lecture. One rather handwaving example will have to suffice. For more details see for instance~\cite{Henning:2014wua,Brehmer:2015rna}.


% % \subsubsection{Scalar singlet}

% Maybe the simplest model of new physics is the extension of the SM by one real scalar singlet, also known as a ``Higgs portal''. This new field $s$ only couples to the Higgs doublet $\phi$ proportional to its mass $m_s$ times a coupling $\lambda_s$. Identifying $\Lambda = m_s$ and integrating out the singlet gives rise to the diagram

%   \label{fig:SFitter}
% \end{figure}
% %-----------------------------------------------------------

% Results from the LHC, LEP, and other experiments constrain the Wilson coefficients of Higgs EFT. So far the experimental collaborations have not published such limits themselves, but a number of phenomenologists are working on it. Fig.~\ref{fig:SFitter} shows results from a fit of dimension-6 operators to LHC run~I data~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa}. In addition to total rates, this study takes into account distributions in the Higgs-strahlung and weak boson fusion channels.\footnote{Regrettably, ATLAS and CMS have published only a few of the distributions of interest.}

% It turns out that analyzing kinematic distributions indeed tightens the constraints on some operators. This constraining power comes in particular from the high-energy bins (remember the discussion around Fig.~\ref{fig:OW_Zh_demo}). Overall, no significant deviation from the SM (all dimension-6 coefficients zero) has been found. The upper limits on the Wilson coefficients are roughly around
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac {|f|} {\Lambda^2} \lesssim 5 \ \tev^{-2} \,.
% \end{equation}

% Wait\dots what?

% This number should set alarm bells ringing. Inverting it yields
% \begin{equation}
%   \Lambda \gtrsim \sqrt{|f|} \cdot 400\ \gev \,. 
% \end{equation}
% For a strongly coupled underlying system, we expect large Wilson coefficients $f$, and $\Lambda$ must at least be around a few TeV. But if physics beyond the SM is weakly coupled, we expect Wilson coefficients $|f| \lesssim \ord{1}$, and $\Lambda$ can be as low as a few hundred GeV. Compare this to the typical energy scale of the processes we describe. Total Higgs production rates at the LHC probe a typical energy of $E \sim m_h$. More importantly, we just argued that fits rely on the high-energy bins of distributions, which contain events with a typical momentum transfer of up to
% \begin{equation}
%   E \sim 500 \ \gev\,.
% \end{equation}

% If the underlying model is weakly coupled, LHC measurements are currently only sensitive to scenarios with $\Lambda \sim E$. The lack of a separation between $E$ and $\Lambda$ means that the EFT will not necessarily provide a good approximation to full models of new physics! The EFT validity is only guaranteed for more strongly coupled scenarios.  Designed to be as model-independent as possible, the EFT description of Higgs physics only seems justified for certain classes of models.\footnote{The dark matter community has been discussing a similar problem. In that field EFTs work very well to describe direct detection experiments, in which the momentum transfer is very low, and annihilation in the early universe. But dark matter production at the LHC probes much higher energy scales, and it turns out that the usual effective theories are not valid anymore.}

%   \label{fig:EFT_limits}
% \end{figure}
% %-----------------------------------------------------------

% Still, as we argued above Higgs EFT has many desirable features, and there is no obvious alternative for a model-independent parametrization of electroweak physics. If and how the dimension-6 Lagrangian is useful for Higgs physics at the LHC is quite a hot topic right now. In Refs.~\cite{Brehmer:2015rna,Biekoetter:underconstruction} we have tackled this question by explicitly comparing the Higgs phenomenology of complete models of new physics and the corresponding EFT.

% We find that the dimension-6 Lagrangian is surprisingly powerful: its operators can describe nearly all effects expected in Higgs physics from typical weakly interacting SM extensions. Resonances from new light particles are an obvious exception. Higgs pair production is problematic because intricate cancellations between amplitudes are not well reproduced by the EFT. Total rates and distributions in single Higgs production, however, are well described by the dimension-6 Lagrangian. Here the lack of a scale hierarchy between $E$ and $\Lambda$ leads to one complication in the matching procedure: subleading terms suppressed by powers of $v^2 / \Lambda^2$ can be important even though they correspond to dimension-8 operator effects. Including these terms in the dimension-6 Wilson coefficients, a procedure dubbed ``$v$-improvement'', is then necessary to guarantee that Higgs EFT captures the new physics effects. This subtlety is no problem for a fit of dimension-6 operators to experimental data, it only plays a role when translating limits on Wilson coefficients to parameters of complete models.

% Let us illustrate this with one example. As new physics scenario, consider a heavy vector boson added to the SM. Through mixing with the $W$ and $Z$, it affects the Higgs-gauge interactions, changing kinematic distribution in addition to total rates. In the EFT this is mapped onto (among others) the operator $\ope{W}$, which was discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_pheno}. Fig.~\ref{fig:EFT_limits} shows how this scenario affects distributions in two of the main Higgs production modes, Higgs-strahlung and weak boson fusion. The predictions of the full model are reasonably well approximated by the EFT based on $v$-improved matching, while the naive matching leads to gross errors and is ultimately useless.




% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsubsection{Summary}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% There is nothing strange or complicated about effective field
% theories. They simply provide an organized way of doing what we always
% do in physics: neglecting effects that do not matter for a given
% question. EFTs in the form of quantum field theories consist of a set
% of (typically non-renormalizable) operators. You have seen how this
% framework allows us to start with a full theory and constructive an
% effective approximation from the top down, and how it even allows us
% to construct an approximate description of physics even if we do not
% know the underlying theory.

% At TeV energies find ourselves in the latter bottom-up
% situation. There has to be physics beyond the standard model, and it
% better be accessible by the LHC experiments, but we do not know what
% it is.  Higgs effective field theory is designed as a
% model-independent language that captures the effects of such new
% physics on electroweak-scale observables. Its minimal version consists
% of 59 dimension-6 operators, some of which parametrize changes in
% kinematic structures in the interactions of Higgs and gauge bosons. A
% global fit to these operators works fine, especially if distributions
% are included. Concerns about the validity of this effective theory
% have to be taken seriously, but so far it seems that this language is
% the way to go as long as no new light particles are discovered.
