\chapter{Higgs effective theory at its limits}
\label{chapter:validity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\firstword{H}{iggs effective theories} can universally describe all
signatures expected from new physics as long as its mass scale
$\Lambda$ is sufficiently separated from the experimentally accessible
scale. However, the limited precision of the LHC means that Higgs
measurements are often only sensitive to models with scales not much
higher than the electroweak scale. In this chapter we discuss if and
when the EFT approach is nevertheless useful, and how its validity can
be improved.

In Section~\ref{sec:validity_introduction} we discuss the LHC
sensitivity and its implications for effective theories, and formulate
our strategy to test the dimension-six approach. In
Section~\ref{sec:validity_matching} we discuss some crucial details of
the matching between full models and EFTs, and introduce the novel
``$v$-improved'' matching
procedure. Section~\ref{sec:validity_full_vs_effective} contains the
bulk of our results, the comparison of full models to their EFT
approximations for a variety of models and observables. We go into
more detail and analyse some practical questions in a specific example
case in Section~\ref{sec:validity_practical_questions}, and finally
present our conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:validity_conclusions}.

Most of the work presented in this chapter was published in
Refs.~\cite{Brehmer:2015rna, Biekotter:2016ecg, deFlorian:2016spz},
and the results and a large part of the presentation are identical to
that in these publications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:validity_introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Energy scales in Higgs measurements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There is no doubt that effective field theories work extraordinarily
well as long as there is a scale hierarchy between the experimentally
probed energy and the new physics scale, $E \ll \Lambda$. On the other
hand, it is clear that the EFT expansion breaks down at
$E \geq \Lambda$, where an infinite number of operators contributes at
the same size and the model is neither predictive nor
renormalisable. The validity of the effective theory in the
intermediate region,
%
\begin{equation}
  E \lesssim \Lambda \,,
  \label{eq:validity_muddy_waters}
\end{equation}
%
is less obvious and will depend on the specific underlying model as
well as on the observable studied. So in which of these categories do
LHC Higgs measurements belong?

Higgs production at hadron colliders does not probe a single
experimental energy scale over the full relevant phase space. The
momentum transfer is bounded from below by the Higgs mass. Selection
criteria necessary to separate a signal from the QCD backgrounds often
require a higher momentum transfer $E > m_h$. More importantly, most
of the information on operators with derivatives comes from
high-energy tails, as demonstrated in
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_pheno}. During run~1, significant
event numbers are recorded within the range
%
\begin{equation}
  m_h \leq E \lesssim \ord{400~\gev} \,,
  \label{eq:validity_experimental_energy_scale}
\end{equation}
%
depending on the process, observable, collected amount of data, and
analysis methods.

On the other hand, we can roughly estimate the new physics scale
$\Lambda$ that LHC Higgs measurements are able to probe. Assuming a
$10\%$ precision on total Higgs rate measurements and no loop
suppression of new physics effects, such a signature lies within the
experimental reach of the LHC if
%
\begin{equation}
  \left| \frac{\sigma \times \text{BR}}{\left( \sigma \times \text{BR} \right)_\text{SM}} - 1 \right|
  = \frac{g^2 m_h^2}{\Lambda^2}
  \gtrsim 10\%
  \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad 
  \Lambda < \frac{g \, m_h}{\sqrt{10\%} } \, \approx g \, 400~\gev \,.
  \label{eq:validity_probed_scale_estimation}
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ are the typical couplings of the underlying theory.
%
% For loop-induced new physics effects, the corresponding loop
% suppression factor pulls $\Lambda$ to even lower values,
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   \left| \frac{\sigma \times \text{BR}}{\left( \sigma \times \text{BR} \right)_\text{SM}} - 1 \right|
%   = \frac{ g^2 m_h^2}{16 \pi^2 \Lambda^2}
%   \gtrsim 10\%
%   \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad 
%   \Lambda < \frac{g \, m_h}{4 \pi \sqrt{10\%} } \, \approx g \,30~\gev \,.
%   \label{eq:validity_probed_scale_estimation_loops}
% \end{equation}

This simple estimation shows that the scale separation $E/\Lambda$ is
limited by the experimental precision and crucially depends on the
size of the couplings of underlying physics. For very weakly coupled
theories, $g^2 < 1/2$, only new physics models with new particles at
or below the electroweak scale can leave measurable signatures in
Higgs observables, and the EFT approach clearly does not make
sense. For truly strongly coupled theories, $1 < g \lesssim 4 \pi$,
new physics scenarios up to $\Lambda \lesssim 5~\tev$ are relevant,
and the EFT expansion converges flawlessly. In fact, the EFT approach
to Higgs observables has largely been motivated by the desire to
describe models with strongly interacting electroweak symmetry
breaking~\cite{Giudice:2007fh}. For moderately weakly to moderately
strongly coupled theories, $1/2 \lesssim g^2 \lesssim 2$, the LHC
Higgs programme is sensitive to scales
%
\begin{equation}
  280~\gev \lesssim \Lambda \lesssim 560~\gev
  \label{eq:validity_probed_scale_weakly_interaction}
\end{equation}
%
This corresponds exactly to the intermediate region defined in
Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_muddy_waters}.

In this simple argument we ignored that new physics might also change
distributions and especially affect the high-energy tails or off-shell
regions.
%
% In particular the increased statistics and Higgs production cross
% sections at Run~II will enable us to add a wide range of
% distributions and off-shell processes to the Higgs observables.  A
% well-known example is weak boson fusion, where the details of the
% ultraviolet completion can have a huge effect for example on the
% transverse momenta of the tagging jets~\cite{bad_one, spins,
% phi_jj,higgs_pole}.
%
A thorough global fit of Higgs results including kinematic information
confirms the rough estimate given in
Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_probed_scale_weakly_interaction}~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa}.

We conclude that for moderately weakly coupled scenarios of new
physics, the limited precision of LHC Higgs measurements cannot
guarantee a clear scale hierarchy, and the effective field theory
approach cannot be trusted blindly. But this does not mean that an
analysis of LHC data in terms of a truncated dimension-six Lagrangian
cannot be useful. Instead, the applicability of the dimension-six
model now depends on the nature of the underlying physics as well as
on the process and observable, and has to be carefully checked for
each situation.

From a practical perspective, in Ref.~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa} is has
been shown that a fit of dimension-six operators to the Higgs data at
Run~I is a sensible and practicable extension of the usual Higgs
couplings fit.  As discussed at length in the previous chapter,
dimension-six operators including derivatives complement the Higgs
coupling modifications and allow us to extract information from
kinematic distributions. Even if the LHC constraints do not induce a
hierarchy of scales, and the EFT approach is not formally well
defined, there appears to be no problem in describing the LHC Higgs
data in terms of a truncated dimension-six Lagrangian. This
description induces theory uncertainties if we want to interpret the
LHC results in terms of an effective field
theory~\cite{Berthier:2015gja}. On the other hand, these and other
theory uncertainties can and should be separated from the experimental
uncertainties~\cite{Cranmer:2013hia, Fichet:2015xla}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Questions for the EFT approach}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter we analyse the usefulness of the dimension-six
description of the Higgs sector with a comprehensive comparison of
full models and their dimension-six description. As argued above, the
EFT validity has to be tested on a process-to-process as well as
model-to-model basis.  We therefore select four represantative models
of new physics, map them onto dimension-six operators, and compare the
predictions of the full and the effective model in various Higgs
observables.

We select moderately weakly interacting extensions of the Higgs sector
of the Standard Model by
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item a scalar singlet,
\item a scalar doublet,
\item a coloured top-partner scalar, and
\item a massive vector triplet.
\end{enumerate}
%
For each of these models we pick a number of parameter benchmark
points, designed to highlight phenomenogical features of the model,
and to be within the experimental reach of the LHC Higgs programme.

The corresponding EFT descriptions are constructed by integrating out
the heavy fields and expanding the effective action to
$\ord{1/\Lambda^2}$. In other words, we match the theories to the
dimension-six operators of the linear Higgs EFT introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_operators}. The details of this
matching procedure are a key element of our analysis and will be
discussed in detail in the next section.

For all these scenarios, we calculate the Higgs couplings, and in a
next step rates and distributions for selected Higgs production modes
and decay channels. The key questions we aim to address are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Given the LHC sensitivity, how large do relevant new physics
  effects have to be? Does the corresponding new physics scale
  correspond to a scale separation $\Lambda \gg v$?
%
\item Which observables are correctly described by the truncated EFT?
  Where does the EFT description break down, and why?
%
\item Do these discrepancies pose a problem for LHC analyses? Is the
  parametrisation of Higgs properties with dimension-six operators
  useful?
\end{itemize}
%
In this way, we analyse what problems the lack of a clear hierarchy of
scales leads to in practice, and discuss how these might affect global
LHC-Higgs fits including kinematic distributions. Turning the argument
around, we ask whether and when the analysis of a UV-complete model
offers an advantage compared to the effective theory.

% It will turn out that two limitations of the EFT description will
% guide us through the different models. First, we need to ensure that
% the new physics scale and with it all new particles are properly
% decoupled, in particular when we go beyond total cross
% sections. Second, when we define our effective field theory in terms
% of a Higgs-Goldstone doublet, it is crucial that the electroweak
% vacuum expectation value (VEV) does not have a destabilising effect on
% the hierarchy of scales.

\newparagraph
%
After this broad survey of the applicability of dimension-six
operators, we focus on the vector triplet scenario and WBF Higgs
production and briefly discuss some practical aspects. The first
question is whether it is justified or preferable to include the
square of dimension-six operators in calculations while neglecting
dimension-eight operators interfering with the SM. Both contribute at
the same order $\ord{1/\Lambda^4}$ to the squared amplitude.

We also discuss is whether a naive simplified model with a new light
scalar can improve the description where the EFT breaks down, analyse
the correlation of different kinematic observables with the
unobservable momentum transfer in WBF Higgs production, and check
whether the differences between full and effective descriptions
survive a realistic parton shower and jet reconstruction.

\newparagraph
%
In addition and mostly simultanously to our work, published in
Refs.~\cite{Brehmer:2015rna, Biekotter:2016ecg}, the applicability of
EFTs to Higgs physics at the LHC was studied in a range of different
situations~\cite{Biekoetter:2014jwa, Arnesen:2008fb, Englert:2014cva,
  deVries:2014apa, Craig:2014una, Dawson:2015gka, Edezhath:2015lga,
  Gorbahn:2015gxa, Edelhaeuser:2015zra, Drozd:2015kva,
  Englert:2015hrx, Contino:2016jqw, Freitas:2016iwx,
  deFlorian:2016spz}. Such questions first arose in studies of tagging
jet kinematics in weak boson fusion, which are sensitive to the UV
structure of the theory~\cite{Alwall:2007ed, Hagiwara:2009wt,
  Englert:2012xt, Brehmer:2014pka}. Similar issues appear in
Higgs-strahlung~\cite{Biekoetter:2014jwa}, in the production of
(potentially off-shell) Higgs bosons in gluon
fusion~\cite{Azatov:2014jga, Buschmann:2014sia, Dawson:2015gka,
  Drozd:2015kva, Azatov:2016xik}, and in electroweak precision
observables as well as Higgs decays to photons~\cite{Freitas:2016iwx}

The problem of a lack of scale hierarchy is not unique to the EFT
approach. As discussed at the end of
Section~\ref{sec:foundations_heft_alternatives}, pseudo-observables
rely on the same expansion in $1/\Lambda$, and the breakdown of this
expansion has been studied in Ref.~\cite{Greljo:2015sla}.

As an aside, similar concerns have fuelled an intense investigation in
the context of dark matter searches~\cite{Shoemaker:2011vi,
  Busoni:2013lha, Buchmueller:2013dya, Busoni:2014sya, Racco:2015dxa,
  Bauer:2016pug}.  While in that field EFT-based predictions are
usually robust for early-universe and late-time annihilation rates as
well as for dark matter-nucleon scattering, the required hierarchy of
scales often breaks down for dark matter signals at colliders.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Matching in the Time of LHC Run~2}
\label{sec:validity_matching}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ambiguities}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before discussing the individual models and presenting our results, we
have to define how we construct the effective models.  Matching the
dimension-six Lagrangian to a full model is a three-step procedure.
Its starting point is the definition of a heavy mass scale $\Lambda$.
Second, we integrate out the degrees of freedom above $\Lambda$ as
described in Section~\ref{sec:foundations_matching}, which leads to an
infinite tower of higher-dimensional operators.  Finally, this
effective action is truncated so that only the dimension-six terms,
suppressed by $1 / \Lambda^2$, remain.

The matching is not unambiguous: on the one hand, $\Lambda$ is usually
not uniquely defined. A typical case is a new physics scenario with
only one heavy mass scale $M$ in the Lagrangian, but also some mixing
terms of the new fields with the SM Higgs doublet. In the unbroken
electroweak phase the only new physics scale is then
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_1 = M \,.
\end{equation}
%
But after electroweak symmetry breaking, the electroweak vev
contributes through the mixing term to the actual physical masses $m$
of the new particles. Even if there is only one dimensionful scale of
new physics in the Lagrangian, this defines additional scales of the
form
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_2^2 = m^2 = M^2 \pm g^2 v^2 \,,
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ is a combination of couplings or mixing angles. Of course
there can be many such scales.

Further ambiguities arise in the third step since we can choose which
parameters to keep constant while expanding in $1/\Lambda$. For
instance we can often choose to define Wilson coefficients in terms of
Lagrangian couplings or in terms of mixing angles. Again, the first
choice corresponds to the natural choice in the unbroken phase of the
electroweak symmetry, while the latter is often only defined in the
broken phase.

In both scenarios, switching from one choice to another corresponds to
including additional contributions suppressed by $v^2/\Lambda^2$ to
the Wilson coefficients of the dimension-six operators. In the first
example,
%
\begin{align}
  \frac {f_x} {\Lambda_2^2} \, \ope{x}
  %
  &= \frac  {f_x}  {M^2 \pm g^2 v^2}\, \ope{x}
    %
  = \frac  {f_x}  {M^2} \left (1 \mp \frac {g^2 v^2} {M^2} + \ord{1/M^4} \right) \ope{x} \notag \\
  %
  &= \left( \frac  {f_x}  {\Lambda_1^2} \mp \frac { f_x g^2 v^2}{\Lambda_1^4} \right) \ope{x}
    + \ord{1/\Lambda_1^6} \,.
\end{align}

It should be stressed that these effects always contribute to
observables at $\ord{1/\Lambda^4}$, the same order in the EFT
expansion as the leading effects from dimension-eight operators, which
we always neglect. From a purely theoretical point of view these terms
are subleading, and indeed in the obvious validity regime of the EFT
they are irrelevant. But this is not the situation we find at the
LHC. In practice, these formally suppressed terms may be important
even if the dimension-eight terms are small.

These ambiguities in the matching procedure raise the question if we
can improve the agreement between full model and dimension-six
Lagrangian by incorporating effects of the non-zero electroweak vev in
the matching. To answer this question we now define two different
matching prescriptions.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Default vs.\ $v$-improved matching}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our \emph{default matching} follows a purely theoretical motivation
and represents the conventional approach to matching. The linear Higgs
EFT is formulated in terms of the doublet $\phi$ and based on the
assumption $\Lambda \gg v$. It should therefore be matched to the full
theory in the unbroken phase of the electroweak symmetry. An obvious
choice for the matching scale is then the mass scale of new particles
in the limit of $v \to 0$, which as in our simple example above we
denote
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_{\text{default}} = M \,.
\end{equation}
%
For simplicity we assume there is only one such scale, \ie that all
new particles are mass-degenerate in the unbroken electroweak
phase. Otherwise the new particles would have to be integrated out
consecutively at different scales $M_i$. We then expand the effective
action, expressed in parameters of the Lagrangian, and drop all terms
of $\ord{\Lambda^{-4}}$.

Alternatively, we define a \emph{$v$-improved matching} procedure that
accounts for additional terms suppressed by $v^2 / \Lambda^2$ in the
Wilson coefficients of the dimension-six Lagrangian. This corresponds
to matching the linear EFT in the broken electroweak phase. In the
first matching step, we define $\Lambda$ as the physical mass $m$ of
the new particles in the broken phase including contributions from
$v$,
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_{\text{$v$-improved}} = m \,,
\end{equation}
%
rather than the mass scale in the unbroken phase. Again, multiple
particles with substantial mass splittings will require a multi-step
matching procedure, but there is no fundamental problem to describe
them. The Wilson coefficients are expressed in terms of
phenomenologically relevant quantities such as mixing angles and
physical masses, again defined in the broken phase. This is a somewhat
subjective criterion that depends on model and process: the
$v$-improved matching procedure is not a unique definition, but rather
a general guideline. We will demonstrate an example for a natural
choice in the singlet scenario.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Making sense of $v$-improvement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We can interpret the two matching schemes from two different
perspectives. First we analyse it from the unbroken electroweak
phase. Some of the operators with dimension 8 or higher are of the
form
%
\begin{equation}
  \ope{i}^{(d=6 + 2n)} = ( \phisq)^n \ope{i}^{(6)} \,,
  \label{eq:validity_dim8_phisq_dim6}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ope{i}^{(6)}$ is a dimension-six operator. The untruncated,
infinite tower of higher-dimensional operators generated from the full
theory can be re-organised as
%
\begin{align}
  \lgr{EFT}
  %
  &\equiv \lgr{SM}
    + \sum_{d=6}^\infty \sum_i \frac {f_i^{(d)}} {\Lambda^{d-4}} \ope{i}^{(d)} \notag \\
  %
  &= \lgr{SM}
  + \sum_i \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {f_i^{(6+2n)}} {\Lambda^{2+2n}} \left( \phisq \right)^n \ope{i}^{(6)}
  + \sum_{d=8}^\infty \sum_k \frac {f_k^{(d)}}  {\Lambda^{d-4}} \ope{k}^{(d)} \,,
\end{align}
%
where $\smash{\ope{k}^{(d)}}$ are the dimension-eight and higher
operators of a different form than
Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_dim8_phisq_dim6}.  A $v$-improved matching
corresponds to replacing $\phisq \to v^2 / 2$ in (part of) the first
sum:\footnote{The argument is slightly more complicated if additional
  powers of $\phi$ appear in $\smash{\ope{i}^{(6)}}$. One can then
  also take into account terms where instances of $\phi$ in
  $\smash{\ope{i}^{(6)}}$ are replaced by the vev and fields in the
  prefactor are left alone. This effectively adds a combinatorical
  factor to Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_v-improvement_resummation}.}
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{$v$-improved dim-6} = \lgr{SM}
  + \sum_i
  \frac { \overbrace{\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_i^{(6+2n)}  \left( \frac {v^2} {2\Lambda^{2}} \right)^n}^{f_i^{(6), \text{$v$-improved}}} }
  {\Lambda^2}
  \ope{i}^{(6)} \,.
  \label{eq:validity_v-improvement_resummation}
\end{equation}
%
So from the perspective of the unbroken phase of the electroweak
symmetry, $v$-improvement corresponds to a \emph{partial resummation
  of dimension-eight and higher operators} into the Wilson
coefficients of the dimension-six operators.
 
From an experimental point of view, or in the broken electroweak
phase, physical masses and mixing angles are simply the natural
choices to describe a model. We then expect that the $v$-improved
matching procedure can improve the validity of the dimension-six
model. For a more precise statement we have to distinguish between an
expansion in $v/\Lambda$ and $\mathbf{p}/\Lambda$. We expect the
$v$-improved matching prescription can lead to a better agreement with
the full models in situations where the expansion in $v/\Lambda$ is
relevant, while it cannot help with the expansion in
$\mathbf{p}/\Lambda$, corresponding to genuine new dimension-eight
operators not of the form in
Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_dim8_phisq_dim6}. We will come back to this
difference later and demonstrate it in the vector triplet scenario.

Again, the truncation of the EFT Lagrangian is formally justified as
long as $v \ll \Lambda$ and we only probe energies $E \ll \Lambda$.
In this limit the dimension-eight operators as well as the
$\Lambda$-suppressed terms in the Wilson coefficients are negligible;
our two matching procedures then give identical results. In the
absence of a large enough scale separation, our bottom-up approach
allows us to treat them independently. This way we can use the
$v$-improved matching to enhance the validity of the dimension-six
Lagrangian.

% The external energy scale depends on the specific process and
% observable, \eg $E_{\text{phys}} \sim m_h$ for on-shell Higgs coupling
% measurements, $E_{\text{phys}} \sim m_{4 \ell}$ for off-shell Higgs
% coupling measurements, $E_{\text{phys}} \sim m_{hh}$ for Higgs pair
% production at threshold, or $E_{\text{phys}} \sim p_{T,h}$ for boosted
% single or double Higgs production. In kinematic distributions the
% high-energy tails can probe significantly larger energy scales.  This
% implies that the energy range where the EFT description is applicable
% is model-dependent and observable-dependent. Successively adding
% higher-dimensional operators should improve the situation, as long as
% the key scales $E_{\text{phys}}, \Lambda$ are sufficiently
% separated. Of course, the EFT description fails spectacularly in the
% presence of new resonances in the relevant energy range, and we have
% to adjust the field content of the effective Lagrangian.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Full models vs.\ effective theory}
\label{sec:validity_full_vs_effective}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The main aim of this chapter is to compare a comprehensive set of LHC
predictions from specific new physics models to their corresponding
effective field theory predictions. In this way we test the
applicability of the dimension-six model for four different, more or
less UV-complete, scenarios of underlying physics:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item a scalar singlet extension with mixing effects and a second
  scalar resonance;
\item a two-Higgs doublet model, adding a variable Yukawa structure, a
  CP-odd, and a charged Higgs;
\item scalar top partners, contributing to Higgs couplings at one
  loop; and
\item a vector triplet with gauge boson mixing.
\end{enumerate}
%
This ensemble of models covers a wide range of $CP$-even new physics
signatures in the Higgs sector.

After describing our technical setup, we analyse these four scenarios
one by one. For each model we first define the theory and introduce
the main phenomenological features at the LHC. We discuss the
decoupling in the Higgs sector, and derive the dimension-six
setup. Finally, we define a number of benchmark points and give a
detailed account of the full and dimension-six phenomenology at the
LHC.

Effects in the SM-like Higgs couplings will be parametrised with the
relative shifts from the SM values
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_x \equiv \frac {g_{hxx}} {g_{hxx}^{\text{SM}}} - 1\,,
\end{equation}
%
as defined in Equation~\eqref{eq:foundations_kappa_delta}. Unlike in the
published version~\cite{Brehmer:2015rna}, we express the effective
Lagrangian in the HISZ basis with the ten dimension-six operators of
Equation~\eqref{eq:foundations_operators_even}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Setup}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our comparison covers the most relevant observables for LHC Higgs
physics. Acceptance and background rejections cuts are kept to a
minimum to be able to test the effective field theory approach over as
much of the phase space as possible.

In the case of Higgs production through gluon fusion, we analyse the
production process with a Higgs decay to four leptons or to photons,
%
\begin{align}
  g g &\to h \to 4 \ell \,,\notag \\
  g g &\to h \to \gamma \gamma \,.
  \label{eq:validity_gg_4l_process}
\end{align}
%
For the photons we do not apply any cuts, while for $\ell = e, \mu$ we
require
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{4 \ell} > 100 \ \gev \quad \text{and} \quad
  m_{\ell^+\ell^-}^\text{same flavour} > 10 \ \gev \,
\end{equation}
%
to avoid too large contributions from the $Z$ peak and
bremsstrahlung.

For Higgs production in weak boson fusion (WBF), we evaluate the
production process
%
\begin{equation}
  u d \to h \, u d
  \to W^+ W^- \, ud
  \to (\ell^+ \nu) \, (\ell^- \bar{\nu}) \, ud \,,
\label{eq:validity_wbf_proc}
\end{equation}
%
which is the dominant partonic contribution at the LHC. We require the standard
WBF cuts
%
\begin{align}
  p_{T,j} &> 20 \ \gev \,, &
 \Delta \eta_{jj} &> 3.6 \,, &
  m_{jj} &> 500 \ \gev \,, \notag \\
  p_{T,\ell} &> 10 \ \gev  \,, &
  \met &> 10 \ \gev \,.
  \label{eq:validity_wbf_cuts}
\end{align}
%
Unlike for gluon fusion, the kinematics of the final state can now
introduce new scales and a dependence on the UV structure of the
model. The process is particularly interesting in the context of
perturbative unitarity~\cite{Cornwall:1974km, Cornwall:1973tb,
  LlewellynSmith:1973yud, Weldon:1984th, Weldon:1984wt, Gunion:1990kf,
  Corbett:2015lfa}. While the latter is satisfied in a UV-complete
model by construction, deviations from the SM Higgs-gauge couplings in
the EFT may lead to an increasing rate at very large
energies~\cite{Han:2009em, Brehmer:2014pka}, well outside the EFT
validity range $E / \Lambda \ll 1$.  To look for such signatures, we
focus on the high-energy tail of the transverse mass distribution,
%
\begin{equation}
  m_T^2 = \left( E_{T,\ell \ell } + E_{T,\nu \nu }
  \right)^2 - \left( \mathbf{p}_{T,\ell \ell } +
  \mathbf{p}_T^{\text{miss}} \right)^2 
  \label{eq:validity_mT}
\end{equation}
%
with
%
\begin{equation}
  E_{T,\ell \ell } = \sqrt{\mathbf{p}_{T,\ell \ell }^2 + m_{\ell \ell}^2} \,, \quad
  E_{T,\nu \nu } = \sqrt{\met + m_{\ell \ell }^2} \,.
\end{equation} 

As the last single Higgs production process we evaluate
Higgs-strahlung
%
\begin{equation}
  q q \to V h
\end{equation}
%
with $V = W^\pm, Z$. We do not simulate the Higgs and gauge boson
decays, assuming that we can always reconstruct for example the full
$Zh \to \ell^+ \ell^- \, b \bar{b}$ final state. No cuts are applied.

Finally, Higgs pair production,
%
\begin{equation}
  g g \to h h \,,
\end{equation}
%
is well known to be problematic when it comes to the effective theory
description~\cite{Baur:2002rb, Gillioz:2012se, Dawson:2012mk}. Again,
neither Higgs decays nor kinematic cuts are expected to affect our
analysis, so we leave them out.

\newparagraph
%
We test all these channels for the singlet and doublet Higgs sector
extensions. For the top partner and vector triplet models we focus on
the WBF and Higgs-strahlung modes.

In the dimension-six simulations we always include the square of the
dimension-six operator contributions. While these terms are
technically of the same mass dimension as dimension-eight operators,
which we neglect, we keep them to avoid negative values of the squared
matrix element in extreme phase-space regions. Notice that these
situations do not necessarily imply a breakdown of the EFT
expansion. On the contrary, they may appear in scenarios where new
physics contributions dominate over the SM part, while the EFT
expansion is fully valid (with $E/\Lambda \ll 1$). In such cases, the
bulk effects stem from the squared dimension-six terms instead of the
interference with the SM, while the effects from dimension-eight
operators are smaller and can be safely neglected. We will discuss
this aspect in more detail in the next section.

Most amplitudes are calculated at leading order in $\alpha_s$
and $\alpha_{ew}$, which is sufficient given the size of new physics
effects that the LHC is sensitive to. We always take into account
interference terms between Higgs and gauge amplitudes. 

For tree-level processes we generate event samples with
\toolfont{MadGraph~5}~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, using publicly available
our own model files implemented in
\toolfont{FeynRules}~\cite{Alloul:2013bka}, which provides the
corresponding UFO files~\cite{Degrande:2011ua}.  For the dimension-six
predictions we resort to a modified version of the \toolfont{HEL}
model file~\cite{Alloul:2013naa}.

The Higgs-gluon and Higgs-photon couplings are evaluated with the full
one-loop form fac\-tors~\cite{Djouadi:2005gi}, including top, bottom and
$W$ loops as well as new particles present in the respective
models. For Higgs pair production, we use a modified version of
Ref.~\cite{higgspaircode}, see also Ref.~\cite{Hespel:2014sla}.

Other loop effects are analysed using reweighting: we generate event
samples using appropriate general couplings. Next, we compute the
one-loop matrix element for each phase space point and reweight the
events with the ratio of the renormalised one-loop matrix element
squared to the tree-level model. For the one-loop matrix elements we
utilise \toolfont{FeynArts} and \toolfont{FormCalc}~\cite{Hahn:2000kx}
with our own model files that include the necessary counterterms. The
loop form factors are handled with dimensional regularisation in the
't~Hooft-Veltman scheme, and written in terms of standard loop
integrals. These are further reduced via Passarino-Veltman
decomposition and evaluated with the help of
\toolfont{LoopTools}~\cite{Hahn:1998yk}.

Generally we create event samples of at least 100\,000 events per
benchmark point and process for $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 13$~\tev. We use the \toolfont{CTEQ6L}
pdf~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} and the default dynamical choices of the
factorisation and renormalisation scale implemented in
\toolfont{MadGraph}. For this broad survey of EFT validity we limit
ourselves to parton level and do not apply a detector simulation, a
more realistic simulation will be discussed in the next section. The
mass of the SM-like Higgs is fixed to
$m_h = 125$~\gev~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}. For the top mass we take
$m_t = 173.2$~\gev~\cite{Tevatron:2014cka, ATLAS:2014wva}. The Higgs
width in each model is based on calculations with
\toolfont{Hdecay}~\cite{Djouadi:1997yw}, which we rescale with the
appropriate coupling modifiers and complement with additional decay
channels where applicable.

\subsection{Singlet extension}
\label{sec:validity_singlet}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The simplest extension of the minimal Higgs sector of the Standard
Model is by a real scalar singlet $S$~\cite{Silveira:1985rk,
  Schabinger:2005ei, Patt:2006fw, Pruna:2013bma, Lopez-Val:2014jva,
  Robens:2015gla, Robens:2016xkb}. For the sake of simplicity we
consider a minimal version of the singlet model, in which a discrete
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity forbids additional (\eg cubic) terms in the
potential. The theory is then given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \lgr{singlet}
  \supset (D_\mu\phi)^\dagger\, (D^\mu\phi)
  + \frac 1 2 \, \partial_\mu S \, \partial^\mu S
  - V(\phi,S) \,,
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
%
where the scalar potential has the form
%
\begin{align}
  V(\phi,S) =
  \mu^2_1\, \phisq
  + \lambda_1 \left( \phisq \right)^2
  + \mu^2_2\,S^2 + \lambda_2\,S^4
  + \lambda_3 \left( \phisq \right) S^2 \,.
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_potential}
\end{align}
%
The new scalar $S$ can mix with the SM doublet $\phi$ provided
the singlet develops a vev,
%
\begin{equation}
  \braket{S} = \frac {v_s} {\sqrt{2}} \,.
\end{equation}
%
The mixing angle is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \tan(2\alpha) = \frac{\lambda_3vv_s}{\lambda_2 v_s^2 - \lambda_1v^2}\,.
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_mixing_angle}
\end{equation}
%
Details on the parametrisation and Higgs mass spectrum are given in
Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_models_singlet}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Signatures and decoupling patterns}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The additional scalar singlet affects Higgs physics in three
ways. First, it mixes with the Higgs via the mixing angle $\alpha$,
which leads to a universal rescaling of all Higgs couplings to
fermions and vectors. Second, it modifies the Higgs
self-coupling. Finally, it introduces a new, heavy resonance $H$
coupled to the Standard Model through mixing.

The key parameter is the portal interaction between the doublet and
the singlet fields $\lambda_3(\phisq)\,S^2$, which is responsible for
the mixed mass eigenstates. The mixing reduces the coupling of the
SM-like Higgs $h$ to all Standard Model particles universally,
%
\begin{align}
  \Delta_x = \cos \alpha - 1 \quad 
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_shift}
\end{align}
% 
for $x=W,Z,t,b,\tau,g,\gamma,\dots$.  It also affects the
self-coupling of the light Higgs, which takes on the form
%
\begin{equation}
  g_{hhh} =
  6 \cos^3 \alpha\, \lambda_1 v
  - 3 \cos^2 \alpha \sin \alpha\, \lambda_3 v_s
  + 3 \cos \alpha \sin^2 \alpha\, \lambda_3 v
  - 6 \sin^3 \alpha\, \lambda_2 v_s \,.
\end{equation}

The parameter $\sin\alpha$ quantifies the departure from
the SM limit $\alpha \to 0$.  This limit can be attained in two ways:
first, a small mixing angle can be caused by a weak portal
interaction,
%
\begin{equation}
  \left| \tan(2\alpha) \right|
  = \left| \frac{\lambda_3\,v\,v_s}{\lambda_2 v_s^2 - \lambda_1 v^2} \right|
  \ll 1 \quad \text{if} \quad \lambda_3 \ll 1 \,.
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_limit1}
\end{equation}
%
The Higgs couplings to SM particles approach their SM values, but
there is no large mass scale associated with this limit. In the
extreme case of $\lambda_2,\lambda_3 \ll \lambda_1$ we find small
$\alpha \approx - \lambda_3/\lambda_1 \times v_s/(2v)$ even for
$v_s \lesssim v$.  This situation is to some extent the singlet model
counterpart of the ``alignment without decoupling'' scenario in the
Two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM)~\cite{Gunion:2002zf, Craig:2013hca} or
the MSSM~\cite{Carena:2013ooa, Delgado:2013zfa}. It relies on a weak
portal coupling and a small scale separation, which cannot be properly
described by an effective field theory.

As a second possibility, the additional singlet can introduce a large
mass scale $v_s \gg v$, giving us
% 
\begin{equation}
  \tan \alpha \approx \frac{\lambda_3}{2\lambda_2}\,\frac{v}{v_s}
  \ll 1 \quad \text{if} \quad v \ll v_s \,,
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_limit2}
\end{equation}
% 
where $\lambda_3/(2\lambda_2)$ is an effective coupling of up to order
one. In this limit the heavy Higgs mass, which we identify as the
heavy mass scale, is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  m_H \approx \sqrt{2\lambda_2} \, v_s \,.
\end{equation}

In terms of $m_H$, the Higgs couplings scale like
%
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_x = - \frac{\alpha^2}{2} + \ord{\alpha^3}
  \approx - \frac{\lambda_3^2}{4 \lambda_2}\, \left( \frac{v}{m_H} \right)^2 \,.
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_decoup}
\end{equation}
%
This is a dimension-six effect. If we require $|\Delta_x| \gtrsim 10\%$
to keep our discussion relevant for the LHC, this implies
%
\begin{equation}
  m_H \approx \sqrt{2\lambda_2} \, v_s
  < \frac{\sqrt{5} \lambda_3}{\sqrt{2 \lambda_2}} \, v
  = 390~\text{GeV} \times \frac{\lambda_3}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}} \,.
 \label{eq:validity_singlet_delta3}
\end{equation}
%
If we also assume that the ratio of quartic couplings is of the order
of a perturbative coupling, $\lambda_3/\sqrt{\lambda_2} \lesssim 0.5$,
the LHC reach in the Higgs coupling analysis translates into heavy
Higgs masses below 200~GeV. For strongly coupled scenarios,
$\lambda_3/\sqrt{\lambda_2} \lesssim 1 \dots \sqrt{4\pi}$, the heavy
mass reach increases to $m_H \lesssim 0.4 \dots 1.5$ TeV.  This
suggests that a weakly coupled Higgs portal will fail to produce a
sizeable separation of scales when looking at realistic Higgs coupling
analyses. The question becomes if and where this lack of scale
separation hampers our LHC analyses.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Dimension-six description}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the EFT approach the singlet model only generates $\ope{\phi,2}$ at
dimension six~\cite{Gorbahn:2015gxa}. Before electroweak symmetry
breaking, the only mass scale in the Lagrangian that describes the new
physics is $\mu_2^2 < 0$. Defining the Wilson coefficients suppressed
by this new physics scale gives clearly wrong results, as we will
discuss in the analogous case for the two-Higgs-doublet model in the
next section. Instead identify the leading contribution to the heavy
Higgs mass as the new physics scale in our default matching, in
agreement with the logic
Section~\ref{sec:validity_matching}. Following the discussion of
decoupling patterns above this means
%
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_{\text{default}} = \sqrt{2\lambda_2} \, v_s \approx m_H \,.
\end{equation}
%
The corresponding Wilson coefficient, expressed in terms of Lagrangian
parameters, is
%
\begin{equation}
  \bar{f}_{\phi,2}^{\text{default}} = \frac{\lambda_3^2}{2\lambda_2} \,.
\end{equation}

For the $v$-improved matching, we instead use the actual physical mass
%
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda_{\text{$v$-improved}} = m_H \,.
\end{equation}
%
In the broken phase the Higgs couplings are fully expressed through
the mixing angle $\alpha$ as given in
Equation~\eqref{eq:validity_singlet_shift}. We define
%
\begin{equation}
  f_{\phi,2}^{\text{$v$-improved}} = 2 ( 1 - \cos \alpha) \frac {m_H^2} {v^2} \,.
\end{equation} 
%
which ensures that the Higgs couplings exactly agree between the full
model and the $v$-improved dimension-six description.

  \label{tab:validity_singlet_benchmarks}
\end{table}

We start our numerical analysis by defining five singlet benchmark
points in Table~\ref{tab:validity_singlet_benchmarks}, with heavy Higgses
ranging from $200$ to $1000$~\gev. The first three scenarios are in
agreement with current experimental and theoretical constraints.  This
includes direct mass bounds from heavy Higgs searches at colliders,
Higgs coupling measurements, electroweak precision observables,
perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability~\cite{Pruna:2013bma,
  Lopez-Val:2014jva, Robens:2015gla}. Note that for S4 and S5 the
combination of large heavy Higgs masses together with large mixing
angles is incompatible with perturbative unitarity and electroweak
precision constraints.  We nevertheless keep such benchmarks for
illustration purposes.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Higgs couplings and total rates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Table~\ref{tab:validity_singlet_benchmarks} also shows the universal
shift $\Delta_x$ of the light Higgs couplings, both for the full
singlet model and its dimension-six EFT descriptions. For the default
matching, we find reasonable agreement with the full model for the
scenarios with a heavy additional Higgs, while large discrepancies
appear when the new physics is lighter. In particular, note the
difference between S3 and S4. Both describe the same coupling shift
$\Delta_x = - 0.08$. But while S3 realises this with a weakly coupled
light Higgs, which the default EFT cannot describe, S4 has a heavier,
more strongly coupled Higgs, and the EFT description works.  In all
cases, the $v$-improved EFT by construction predicts the Higgs
couplings correctly.

In Table~\ref{tab:validity_singlet_rates} we show how well the
effective models describe the total Higgs production cross sections in
gluon fusion, WBF and Higgs-strahlung. These numbers confirm what we
expect from the coupling modifications: while the default
dimension-six model predict qualitatively similar shifts in the total
rates, there are rate deviations of up to $10 \%$. In the $v$-improved
EFT we find that the Higgs couplings and total rates agree exactly
with the full model predictions. The dimension-six operators are
entirely sufficient to capture the coupling shifts, but a significant
part of their coefficients are formally of $\ord{v^4/\Lambda^4}$.

  \label{fig:validity_singlet_distributions}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

The most obvious source of discrepancy between the full model and the
EFT is the heavy resonance $H$. It can for example be produced in
gluon fusion and then observed as a peak in the $m_{4\ell}$
distribution. By construction, it will not be captured by the
dimension-six model. We illustrate this in the upper left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_singlet_distributions}. For Higgs-strahlung
production (Figure~\ref{fig:validity_singlet_distributions}, upper
right panel), where the novel $H$ resonance does not appear in an
intermediate Born-level propagator and hence has no impact, we find
instead excellent agreement between both descriptions over the entire
phase space.

The second Higgs has a second, more subtle effect.  In the full model,
both Higgs exchange diagrams are needed to unitarise $WW$
scattering. Correspondingly, the EFT description breaks perturbative
unitarity roughly at the scale~\cite{Han:2009em}
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{WW}^2
  %
  \sim \frac{16 \pi } {\frac {f_{\phi,2}}{\Lambda^2} \left( 1 - \frac{f_{\phi,2} v^2 /\Lambda^2}{4 (1+f_{\phi,2} v^2 /\Lambda^2)} \right)}
  %
  \approx \left( \frac {1.7\ \tev} {\sin \alpha} \right)^2 \,.
  \label{eq:validity_singlet_unitarity_violation}
\end{equation}
%
In our benchmark point S5, this is around 2.8~TeV. The incomplete
cancellations between Higgs and gauge amplitudes means that the
dimension-six model tends to have a larger rate at energies already
below this scale. For this specific benchmark choice, this can be seen
in the lower left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_singlet_distributions}, where we show the
distribution of the transverse mass defined in
Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_mT} in the process
$ u d \to W^+ W^- \, ud \to (\ell^+ \nu) \, (\ell^- \bar{\nu}) \, ud$,
to which WBF production of both $h$ and $H$ contributes.  We observe
that the dimension-six model predicts a slightly higher rate at large
$m_T$ than both the full singlet model and the SM. Given the very mild
signal, which results from the fast decrease in the parton densities
and the small mixing angle for realistic scenarios, such effect is
likely of no relevance for LHC physics. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Higgs pair production}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A more interesting channel to study in the singlet model is Higgs pair
production. The Higgs self-coupling is the only Higgs coupling which
gains a momentum dependence in the matched EFT. In addition, there
exists an approximate cancellation between the two leading amplitudes
in the SM at threshold~\cite{Plehn:1996wb, Li:2013rra}. This induces a
second relevant scale and with it a sensitivity to small deviations in
the Higgs couplings.

In the bottom right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_singlet_distributions} we give the $m_{hh}$
distribution in the full and dimension-six models.  In addition, we
show how the distributions would look in the full model without a $H$
state, and in the EFT without the momentum-dependent (derivative)
terms given in Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_singlet-self}.  Already at
threshold and far away from the $H$ resonance, the interference of the
SM-like terms with the $H$ diagrams makes up a significant part of the
amplitude.  In the EFT, the derivative terms are similarly relevant
already at low energies. Close to threshold, the ($v$-improved)
dimension-six model approximates the full theory well. But this
agreement becomes worse already at moderately larger energies, and
clearly breaks down towards the $H$ pole.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If we limit ourselves to Higgs properties relevant for single Higgs
production at the LHC, the modifications from a singlet extension are
very simple: all Standard Model couplings acquire a common scaling
factor, and no relevant new Lorentz structures appear at tree-level.
The dimension-six setup reproduces this effect correctly: the reduced
couplings to all SM fields alone do not require a large hierarchy of
scales. A standard matching procedure that expands the coefficients to
leading order in $v^2/\Lambda^2$ may lead to sizeable deviations from
the full model. However, a $v$-improved EFT construction that takes
into account higher orders in $v^2/\Lambda^2$ gives perfect agreement
with the full theory. In other words, many of the dimension-eight and
higher operators generated from the singlet model are of the form
$( \phisq)^n \ope{i}^{(6)}$. After EWSB they can be resummed into the
Wilson coefficients of the dimension-six operators as given by
Eq.~\eqref{eq:validity_v-improvement_resummation}.

Higgs pair production is different. There is a large contribution from
off-shell $H$, while in the EFT the $h$ self-coupling involves a
derivative. These different structures lead to discrepancies between
full and effective description that increase with momentum
transfer. Of course, the effective theory by definition does not
include the second resonance, so it fails whenever a heavy Higgs
appears on-shell in the full theory.

\subsection{Two-Higgs-doublet model}
\label{sec:validity_2hdm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM)~\cite{2hdm_review} adds a second
weak doublet with weak hypercharge $Y = +1$ to the SM Higgs sector.
The combined potential reads
%
\begin{alignat}{5} V(\phi_1,\phi_2) =& \,
m^2_{11}\,\phi_1^\dagger\phi_1 + m^2_{22}\,\phi_2^\dagger\phi_2 +
\frac{\lambda_1}{2} \, (\phi_1^\dagger\phi_1)^2 + \frac{\lambda_2}{2}
\, (\phi_2^\dagger\phi_2)^2 + \lambda_3 \,
(\phi_1^\dagger\phi_1)\,(\phi_2^\dagger\phi_2) + \lambda_4 \,
|\phi_1^\dagger\,\phi_2|^2 \notag \\ & + \left[ -
m^2_{12}\,\phi_1^\dagger\phi_2 + \frac{\lambda_5}{2} \,
(\phi_1^\dagger\phi_2)^2 + \text{h.c.}  \right] \,.
\label{eq:validity_2hdmpotential}
\end{alignat}
%
The physical degrees of freedom are two neutral CP-even scalars
$h^0,H^0$, one neutral CP-odd scalar $A^0$, and a set of charged
scalars $H^\pm$. The relevant model parameters are the mixing angle
between the CP-even scalars $\alpha$, the ratio of the vevs $\tan
\beta = v_2/v_1$, and the mixed mass term $m_{12}$. The latter induces
a soft breaking of the discrete $\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry $\phi_i \to
(-1)^{i}\,\phi_i$ (for $i=1,2$).  The two-doublet structure allows for
a rich variety of Higgs couplings to fermions.  We refer the reader to
Appendix~\ref{sec:validity_ap-2hdm} for a detailed account of the model setup,
Higgs spectrum, coupling patterns, and matched effective
description.

Just as the singlet extension, the 2HDM predicts two types of LHC
signatures: \textit{i)} scalar and VEV mixing lead to modified light
Higgs couplings. Unlike for the singlet extension, these coupling
modifications are not universal and reflect the more flexible flavor
structure as well as the multiple scales of the model. \textit{ii)}
There exist three heavy resonances $H^0, A^0, H^\pm$, which should
have near-degenerate masses to avoid custodial symmetry breaking.


The light Higgs coupling to weak bosons $V=W,Z$ always scales like
%
\begin{align} \Delta_V = \sin (\beta - \alpha) - 1 = - \frac{
\cos^2(\beta - \alpha)}{2} + \ord {\cos^4(\beta - \alpha) } \,.
\label{eq:validity_2hdm_shift}
\end{align}
%
We can insert the leading contribution of a mass-degenerate heavy
Higgs sector and find
%
\begin{align} \Delta_V \approx \frac{\sin^2 (2\beta)}{8} \, \left(
\dfrac{v}{m_{A^0}} \right)^4 \,.
\label{eq:validity_2hdm_decoup}
\end{align}
%
While in the singlet model the light Higgs coupling to gauge bosons is
shifted at $\ord {v^2/\Lambda^2}$, Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_singlet_decoup}, the
same coupling is now affected at $\ord{v^4/m_{A^0}^4}$, corresponding
to a dimension-eight effect.

Two aspects turn the decoupling in the general 2HDM into a challenge:
first, delayed decoupling effects appear after electroweak symmetry
breaking~\cite{Haber:2000kq}.  For example, in type-II models we
find~\cite{Lopez-Val:2013yba}
%
\begin{align} \Delta_b = - \tan \beta \, \sqrt{|2 \Delta_V|} +
\Delta_V + \ord{\Delta_V^{3/2}} \approx - \tan \beta \;
\frac{\sin (2\beta)}{2} \, \left( \dfrac{v}{m_{A^0}} \right)^2 \,.
\label{eq:validity_2hdm_delayed}
\end{align}
%
This correction to the bottom Yukawa coupling corresponds to a
dimension-six effect, and already moderate values of $\tan \beta$
significantly delay the decoupling of the heavy 2HDM states in the
Yukawa sector.

Second, unlike in the MSSM the Higgs self-couplings $\lambda_1 \dots
\lambda_5$ and $m_{12}$ are not bounded from above. In combinations
like $\lambda_j v^2$ they contribute to the interactions of the
SM-like Higgs state, effectively inducing a new energy scale through
terms of the kind $\sqrt{|2\Delta_V|} \sqrt{\lambda_j} v$ or
proportional to $m_{12}$. They are significantly less suppressed than
we would expect for the usual suppression
$\sqrt{|2\Delta_V|}$\,---\,in particular if an additional factor $\tan
\beta$ appears in this coupling deviation.

This additional, effectively lower mass scale driven by $v$ leads to
problems with any EFT derived from and matched to the full theory
assuming only one new physics scale. While this should not be viewed
as a problem of the EFT approach in general, it will require a
$v$-improved matching procedure.  

We first match the effective theory to the 2HDM in the unbroken
phase. For this we define the new physics scale in terms of the mass
terms in the potential of Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_2hdmpotential} and ratio of
vevs~\cite{heft_limitations2} as
%
\begin{align} \Lambda^2 = M^2 \equiv m^2_{11}\sin^2\beta +
m^2_{22}\cos^2\beta + m^2_{12} \sin (2\beta) \,.
\end{align}

The 2HDM generates a number of dimension-six operators at tree level,
for which the Wilson coefficients depend on the flavor
structure. While the up-type Yukawa coupling is always modified the
same way, the down-type and lepton couplings are different for type-I
and type-II. We find
%
\begin{align} \bar{c}_u = \bar{c}_d^\text{I\phantom{I}} =
\bar{c}_\ell^\text{I\phantom{I}} &= \phantom{-} \dfrac{\sin (2\beta)
\cot\beta}{2} \left[\frac{\lambda_1}{2} -\frac{\lambda_2}{2}
+\left(\frac{\lambda_1}{2} +\frac{\lambda_2}{2}
-\lambda_3-\lambda_4-\lambda_5\right)\cos (2\beta) \right]
\left(\dfrac {v}{\Lambda} \right)^2 \,, \notag \\ \bar{c}_d^\text{II}
= \bar{c}_\ell^\text{II} &= - \dfrac{\sin (2\beta) \tan \beta}{2}
\left[\frac {\lambda_1} 2-\frac {\lambda_2} 2+\left(\frac {\lambda_1}
2 +\frac {\lambda_2} 2-\lambda_3-\lambda_4-\lambda_5\right)\cos
(2\beta) \right] \left(\dfrac{v}{\Lambda} \right)^2
\,, \label{eq:validity_2hdmmatching1}
\end{align}
%
where the superscripts I and II denote the type of the flavor
structure.

Upon electroweak symmetry breaking, the physical heavy Higgs masses
$m_{H^0}$, $m_{A^0}$, and $m_{H^{\pm}}$ acquire VEV-induced
contributions $\sim \lambda_i v^2$ in addition to contributions from
the heavy scale $M$.  As in the singlet model, we therefore also
consider a $v$-improved matching where the matching scale is $\Lambda
= m_{A^0}$ and the Wilson coefficients are expressed in terms of mass
eigenstates.  In this setup, Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_2hdmmatching1} remains
unchanged, except that $\Lambda$ is identified with $m_{A^0}$.

The two matching schemes exhibit significant differences in the 2HDM;
for instance, the pseudoscalar mass is given by $m^2_{A^0} =
m_{12}^2/(\sin\beta\cos\beta) -\lambda_5\,v^2$. This means that it
does not coincide with $M$, unless we enforce a single mass scale
$m_{11} \approx m_{22} \approx m_{12}$ and $\tan \beta \approx
1$.

The 2HDM benchmark points in Table~\ref{tab:validity_2hdm_benchmarks} are in
agreement with all current constraints, implemented with the help of
\toolfont{2HDMC}~\cite{2hdmc},
\toolfont{HiggsBounds}~\cite{higgsbounds},
\toolfont{SuperIso}~\cite{superiso}, and
\toolfont{HiggsSignals}~\cite{higgssignals}. To better illustrate
certain model features, in some scenarios we tolerate deviations
between $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ in the Higgs couplings
measurements.  The key physics properties of the different 2HDM
scenarios can be summarised as:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[D1] moderate decoupling: with Higgs couplings shifts of up to
$2\sigma$ in terms of the LHC constraints.  This generates
$\Delta_{\tau,b,t} \approx \mathcal{O}(15\%)$ as well as a large $h^0
H^+ H^-$ coupling. Additional Higgs masses around $250\dots350$~GeV
can leave visible imprints.
\item[D2] supersymmetric: reproducing the characteristic mass
splittings and Higgs self-couplings of the MSSM with light
stops~\cite{Carena:2013qia}.
\item[D3] sign-flipped bottom Yukawa: this is possible in type-II
models at large $\tan\beta$, as shown in
Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_2hdm_delayed}~\cite{Ferreira:2014naa}. This can be
viewed as a manifestation of a delayed decoupling~\cite{Haber:2000kq}.
\item[D4] fermiophobic heavy Higgs: possible only in type-I models for
$\sin\alpha =0$. The heavy Higgs $H^0$ is relatively light, but
essentially impossible to observe at the LHC~\cite{Hespel:2014sla,
fermiophobic}.
\end{itemize}
%
In Table~\ref{tab:validity_2hdm_EFT} we show the heavy scales $\Lambda$ and the
Wilson coefficients for both the EFT matched in the unbroken phase and
the $v$-improved EFT construction. In contrast to the singlet model, a
significant $v$-dependence of the heavy masses occurs even for
parameter points in agreement with all relevant experimental and
theoretical constraints. Only in one of our four benchmark scenarios
does the heavy scale $M$ approximate the physical mass $m_{A^0}$. The
matching in the unbroken phase is particular pathological in benchmark
D1, where $M^2$ is negative and the signs of the Wilson coefficients
are switched compared to the $v$-improved matching.

Table~\ref{tab:validity_2HDM_couplings_tree} confirms that matching in the
unbroken phase does not reproduce the modified Higgs couplings, while
the $v$-improved matching essentially captures the coupling shifts
without a strong requirement on the hierarchy of scales. For our
purpose we conclude that the expansion in powers of $v/M$ is not well
controlled, and we have to rely on $v$-improved matching for the
2HDM.

%-----------------------------------------------------------

However, even in the $v$-improved EFT, the dimension-six truncation can
present an important source of deviations. According to
Table~\ref{tab:validity_2HDM_couplings_tree} the operators $\ope{u}$, $\ope{u}$,
and $\ope{\ell}$ modify the Higgs couplings similarly to the mixing,
at least in the limit of small mixing angles. This is clearly visible
\eg in the MSSM-like scenario D2 as well as the fermiophobic scenario
of benchmark D4, which are very well described by the dimension-six
Lagrangian, in spite of the lacking scale separation.

In Table~\ref{tab:validity_2HDM_rates} we show LHC rate predictions by the
dimension-six approach and the full 2HDM.  Depending on the benchmark,
the dimension-six truncation leads to up to $10 \%$ departures.  A
particularly interesting scenario is described by benchmark D3. In the
full model, the bottom Yukawa is exactly sign-flipped, a signature
hardly visible at the LHC.  Generating such a signature from
higher-dimensional operators requires their contributions to be twice
as large as the SM Yukawa coupling due to the enhancement of
$v/\Lambda$ by a large coupling.  The EFT with default matching is
certainly not valid anymore, and even the $v$-improved prescription
fails to capture this coupling shift fully, leading to a significantly
different coupling pattern.  

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:validity_2HDM_resolve_HAA} we illustrate the
coupling deviations in gluon fusion Higgs production with a decay
$h\to \tau^+ \tau^-$. The full 2HDM and the EFT give substantially
different predictions for the size of the Higgs signal, but do not
affect the remaining distribution.

In addition, the charged Higgs contributes to the Higgs-photon
coupling, an effect which is mapped onto the operator
$\ope{\gamma}$. Within the $v$-improved EFT, one finds
%
\begin{align} c_\gamma &= - \frac {g^2 \, \left(\tan \beta + \cot
\beta \right) } {12\,288 \, \pi^2} \, \Bigg[\left(\lambda_1 +
\lambda_2 - 2 \lambda_3 + 6 \lambda_4 + 6 \lambda_5 - 8 \frac
{m_{h^0}^2} {v^2} \right) \sin (2 \beta) \notag \\ &\quad + 2 (
\lambda_1 - \lambda_2) \sin (4 \beta) + (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2- 2
\lambda_3 - 2 \lambda_4 - 2 \lambda_5 ) \sin (6 \beta) \Bigg] \,
\left(\frac {v}{m_{A^0}}\right)^2 \,.
              \label{eq:validity_2hdmmatching2}
\end{align}
%
There appear no non-decoupling term of $\ord{\Lambda^0}$, because the
charged Higgs loop decouples in the limit $m_{A^0} \to \infty$ with
finite $\lambda_i$. If instead we keep $m_{12}$ fixed and let one of
the couplings $\lambda_i$ grow with $m_{A^0}$, the charged Higgs does
not decouple.  Interestingly,
Equations\,\eqref{eq:validity_2hdmmatching1}\,--\,\eqref{eq:validity_2hdmmatching2} show that
in this model it is possible to realise \emph{alignment without
decoupling}
scenarios~\cite{Gunion:2002zf,Craig:2013hca,Carena:2013ooa,Delgado:2013zfa},
where the limit of SM-like couplings is achieved via very small
prefactors of $(v/m_{A^0})^2$, while the additional Higgs states can
remain moderately light\,---\,and hence potentially within LHC reach.

For all our benchmarks we find good agreement between the full 2HDM
and the $v$-improved dimension-six approach for on-shell Higgs decays to
photons.  In Table~\ref{tab:validity_2HDM_couplings_loop} the rescaling of the
Higgs-photon couplings shows slight discrepancies which can nearly
entirely be traced back to the different couplings of the Higgs to the
top and bottom in the loop due to the inaccurate truncation and are
not related to the $H^\pm$ contribution.

This changes for off-shell Higgs production. At $m_{\gamma \gamma}
\gtrsim 2 m_{H^\pm}$, the $H^\pm$ in the loop can resolve the charged
Higgs, enhancing the size of its contribution significantly. This
effect is not captured by the effective operator and leads to a
different behaviour of the amplitude $g g \to h^0 \to \gamma \gamma$
between the full and effective model, as shown in the right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_2HDM_resolve_HAA}. However, the tiny rate and the large
combinatorial background mean that this discrepancy will be irrelevant
for LHC phenomenology. Similar threshold effects have been computed
for the top-induced Higgs-gluon coupling and appear to be similarly
irrelevant in practice~\cite{Buschmann:2014twa}.

The situation in Higgs pair production resembles the observations in

the inaccurate truncation leads to differences in the Higgs--top
couplings between the full and effective model.

% Leaving the discussion of individual benchmarks behind, in
% Figure~\ref{fig:validity_2HDM_correlations} we demonstrate how deviations in the
% signal rates $\mu_{p,d}$ can be correlated,
% cf. Ref.~\cite{Cranmer:2013hia}.  The upper panels illustrate the
% dependence on the decoupling parameter $\sin (\beta - \alpha)$. In all
% cases we choose $\tan\beta = 1.5$, $m_{12} = 0$, degenerate heavy
% Higgs masses $m_{H^{\pm},H^0,A^0}= 500$~GeV, and restrict ourselves to
% $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \ge 0.98$. All signal strength deviations are
% obtained by rescaling the SM production cross section, branching ratio
% and total width~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa}.

% In the limit $\sin (\beta - \alpha)\to 1$ or $\Delta_V \to 0$ we find
% perfect agreement between the full model and the $v$-improved
% dimension-six model.  The latter also captures the non-decoupling part
% of the Higgs-photon coupling in the SM limit, $\mu_{\gamma \gamma} \ne
% 1$.  Away from the SM-like limit the dimension-six model slightly
% overestimates the signal strengths. This can for instance be
% attributed to $\Delta_V$; it remains zero in the EFT while it
% decreases via $\ord{v^4/\Lambda^4}$ corrections in the full
% model. Through the $W$ loop this is also the main reason for the
% deviation in the $\gamma\gamma$ final states. Truncated negative
% $\ord{v^4/\Lambda^4}$ corrections to $\Delta_\tau$ are also in part
% responsible for the slight upward shift of $\mu_{\text{ggF},\tau\tau}$
% in the dimension-six model.  The behavior of the down-type Yukawas in
% type-II models, which are governed by $\Delta_{b,\tau} = -\cos(\beta -
% \alpha) \tan\beta + \ord{v^4/\Lambda^4}$, leads to the strongly
% increased $\gamma\gamma$ rates at large $\tan \beta$, a feature which
% is well reproduced by the EFT.

Eventually, the 2HDM discussion leads us to the same conclusion as the
singlet model: as long as the mixing is small, the new resonances do
not contribute significantly, all the LHC probes in single Higgs
production is a set of three coupling modifications $\Delta_x$. New
Lorentz structures do not play any role for the models
considered. Barring the special case of Higgs pair
production~\cite{Hespel:2014sla,higgspair2hdm} the EFT captures most
relevant aspects of Higgs phenomenology.  A naive construction of the
EFT by matching the effective dimension-six Lagrangian to the 2HDM in
the gauge symmetric phase fails to correctly describe the modified
Higgs boson dynamics in typical 2HDM scenarios, since formally
suppressed terms in $v^2/\Lambda^2$ as well as delayed decoupling or
additional scales can become important for the phenomenologically
relevant scenarios to be tested at the LHC.

New coloured scalar particles are, strictly speaking, not an extension
of the SM Higgs sector, but they can lead to interesting modifications
of the LHC observables. We consider a scalar top-partner sector
mimicking the stop and sbottom sector of the MSSM. Its Lagrangian has
the form
%
\begin{alignat}{5} \lgr{} \supset& \,
(D_{\mu}\,\tilde{Q})^\dagger\,(D^\mu\tilde{Q}) +
(D_\mu\,{\tilde{t}_R})^*\,(D^\mu\,{\tilde{t}_R}) -
\tilde{Q}^\dagger\,M^2\,\tilde{Q}\, -
M^2\,{\tilde{t}_R}^*\,{\tilde{t}_R} \notag \\ &-\kappa_{LL}\,(\phi
\cdot \tilde{Q})^\dagger\,(\phi \cdot\tilde{Q})
-\kappa_{RR}\,({\tilde{t}_R}^*{\tilde{t}_R})\,(\phi^\dagger\,\phi) -
\left[ \kappa_{LR} \, M \, {\tilde{t}_R}^*\,(\phi \cdot \tilde{Q}) +
\text{h.c.} \right]
 \label{eq:validity_partner_lag}.
 \end{alignat}
%
Here, $\tilde{Q}$ and ${\tilde{t}_R}$ are the additional isospin
doublet and singlet in the fundamental representation of
$SU(3)_C$. Their mass terms can be different, but for the sake of
simplicity we unify them to a single heavy mass scale $M$. The singlet
state ${\tilde{b}_{R}}$ is assumed to be heavier and integrated
out. This leaves us with three physical degrees of freedom, the
scalars $\tilde{t}_1$, $\tilde{t}_2$ and $\tilde{b}_2=
\tilde{b}_L$. The eigenvalues of the stop mass matrix
%
\begin{alignat}{5}
 \begin{pmatrix} \kappa_{LL}\dfrac{v^2}{2} + M^2 &
\kappa_{LR}\,\dfrac{vM}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \kappa_{LR}\,\dfrac{vM}{\sqrt{2}}
& \kappa_{RR}\,\dfrac{v^2}{2}\, + M^2
 \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:validity_partner_mass}
\end{alignat}
%
define two masses $m_{\tilde{t}_{1}} < m_{\tilde{t}_{2}}$ and a mixing
angle $\theta_{\tilde{t}}$. Again, we provide a detailed description
of the model setup in Appendix~\ref{sec:validity_ap-partners}.

The main new physics effects in the Higgs sector are loop-induced
modifications of the Higgs interactions, most significantly to
$\Delta_g$, $\Delta_\gamma$, $\Delta_V$, possibly including new
Lorentz structures.  The Yukawa couplings do not change at one loop,
because we do not include gauge boson partners. As a side remark, the
2HDM described in Sec.~\ref{sec:validity_2hdm} combined with the scalar top
partners given here corresponds to the effective description of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in the limit of infinitely heavy
gauginos, sleptons, and light-flavor squarks.  

Adding the top partners, the correction to the $hVV$ coupling in the
limit of small $\theta_{\tilde{t}}$ scales like
%
\begin{align} \Delta_V \approx \frac{\kappa_{LL}^2}{16 \pi^2} \,
\left( \frac{v}{m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}} \right)^2 \,.
\label{eq:validity_partner_decoup}
\end{align}
%
This shift can be sizeable for relatively low stop and sbottom masses,
but also for large couplings $\kappa_{ij}$ to the Higgs sector.

As already noted for the 2HDM, the decoupling of the heavy scalars
becomes non-trivial in the presence of a Higgs VEV. Following
Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_partner_mass} the masses of the heavy scalar are not
only controlled by $M$ in the gauge symmetric phase, but they receive
additional contributions of the type $\kappa_{LR} \, vM$, $\kappa_{LL}
v^2$, or $\kappa_{RR} v^2$ after electroweak symmetry breaking. This
leads to a mass splitting of order $v$ between masses of order
$M$. Large values of $\kappa_{LR}$ increase this splitting. This means
that in the full model the decoupling is best described in terms of
$m_{\tilde{t}_{1}} < M$.

This motivates us to again define two different matching
schemes. First, we stick to our default prescription and carry out the
matching of the linear EFT Lagrangian to the full model in the
unbroken phase. The matching scale $\Lambda$ it then dictated by the
intrinsic heavy field mass scale $M$, and completely unrelated to
$v$. The suppression scale of loop effects in the complete model and
this matching scale in the EFT only agree in the limit $M -
m_{\tilde{t}_{1}} \ll M$.

In this dimension-six approach the stop loops generate a number of
operators,
%
\begin{align} \overline{c}_{g} &=
\cfrac{{m_W}^2}{24\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[ \kappa_{LL} + \kappa_{RR} -
\kappa_{LR}^2\right] &\overline{c}_{\gamma} &=
\cfrac{{m_W}^2}{9\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[ \kappa_{LL} + \kappa_{RR} -
\kappa_{LR}^2\right] \notag \\ \overline{c}_{B} &=
-\cfrac{5{m_W}^2}{12\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[\kappa_{LL} -
\cfrac{31}{50} \kappa_{LR}^2 \right] &\overline{c}_{W} &=
\cfrac{{m_W}^2}{4\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[\kappa_{LL} - \cfrac{3}{10}
\kappa_{LR}^2 \right] \notag \\ \overline{c}_{HB} &=
\cfrac{5{m_W}^2}{12\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[\kappa_{LL} -
\cfrac{14}{25} \kappa_{LR}^2 \right] &\overline{c}_{HW} &= -
\cfrac{{m_W}^2}{4\,(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[\kappa_{LL} - \cfrac{2}{5}
\kappa_{LR}^2 \right] \notag \\ \overline{c}_H &=
\cfrac{v^2}{4(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\Bigg[ 2\kappa_{RR}^2-\kappa_{LL}^2 -
\left( \kappa_{RR} - \frac{1}{2}\kappa_{LL} \right) \kappa_{LR}^2 +
\cfrac{\kappa_{LR}^4}{10} \Bigg] \hspace*{-2cm}&& \notag \\
\overline{c}_T &= \cfrac{v^2}{4(4\pi)^2\,M^2}\,\left[\kappa_{LL}^2 -
\cfrac{\kappa_{LL}\,\kappa_{LR}^2}{2} +
\cfrac{\kappa_{LR}^4}{10}\right] \,.
 \label{eq:validity_c-ew}
\end{align}

In addition, we define a $v$-improved matching at the scale $\Lambda =
m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}$ in the broken phase. The Wilson coefficients we
obtain are the same as in Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_c-ew}, except that $M$ is
replaced by $m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}$.  

Unlike in the previous two models, the top partner loops do not only
induce modifications to the SM Higgs couplings, but induce new Lorentz
structures.  In Table~\ref{tab:validity_partner-benchmarks} we define a set of
parameter space configurations, all with light and almost degenerate
states and small mixing. The corresponding Wilson coefficients in our
two matching schemes are given in Table~\ref{tab:validity_partner-EFT}.
Unrealistic parameter choices with strong couplings are necessary to
generate sizeable loop corrections to the $hVV$
couplings~\cite{Hollik:2008xn}. For fixed masses and mixing, the Higgs
couplings to the top partners depend on the interplay between $M^2$
and the coupling constants $\kappa$. For small mixing and large $M^2$,
light top partner masses require large four-scalar couplings
$\kappa_{ii}$.  Conversely, if $M^2$ is close to the physical masses,
the Yukawa couplings can be small.  This illustrates the balance
between the VEV-dependent (non-decoupling) and the explicit
(decoupling) mass contributions.

  \label{tab:validity_partners_rates}
\end{table}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

Since the contributions from scalar top partners to the Higgs
production in gluon fusion are well known~\cite{hgg-toppartners}, we
focus on corrections to the $hVV$ coupling in WBF and Higgs-strahlung,
shown in Table~\ref{tab:validity_partners_rates}.  In benchmark P1 the WBF cross
section is reduced by about $0.6 \%$ compared to the Standard Model,
with good agreement between effective and full description. Such a
scenario is not relevant for LHC measurements in the foreseeable
future. In more extreme corners of the parameter space the loop
effects in the full model grow, higher-dimensional terms in the EFT
become larger, the validity of the latter worsens, and discrepancies
between both increase.  In benchmarks P2 and P3 the WBF rate is
reduced by $9.1\%$ and $43.5\%$ with respect to the Standard Model.
In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:validity_partners_distributions} we show
that this change in the total rate does not have dramatic effects in
the kinematic distributions.  By construction, the EFT based on the
default matching captures only the formally leading term at
$\ord{v^2/\Lambda^2}$, only giving a reduction of $0.5\%$ and
$2.0\%$. The corresponding difference is again independent for example
of the tagging jet's transverse momentum.  With the $v$-improved
matching, the cross section is reduced by $2.4 \%$ and $17.7 \%$,
still far from the result of the full model.

The results for Higgs-strahlung look similar: in the moderate
benchmark P1 the predictions of the full model and the dimension-six
Lagrangian agree within $0.1 \%$, but in this scenario the overall
deviation from the Standard Model is negligible. In scenarios with
larger loop effects, the dimension-six predictions fails to capture most
of the full top partner loops.  We demonstrate this in the right panel
of Figure~\ref{fig:validity_partners_distributions}.  As for WBF, the agreement
between EFT and full model becomes even worse in benchmark P3, with
numerical results similar to those given for WBF Higgs
production. Again the $v$-improved matching performs better than the
default matching.

To summarise, the top partner model for the first time generates a
large set of dimension-six operators through electroweak loops. However,
in realistic scenarios with a large scale separation the loop
corrections for example to the $hVV$ vertex are tiny.  Pushing for
loop effects that are large enough to leave a visible imprint in WBF
and Higgs-strahlung requires breaking the scale separation between the
observed Higgs scalar and the top partners. In that case the EFT fails
already for the total rates, kinematic distributions hardly add to
this discrepancy.

Heavy vector bosons appear in many new physics scenarios and possibly
also in data~\cite{ww_resonance}. Their properties can be tested in
Higgs measurements, provided they are connected to the gauge-Higgs
sector of the Standard
Model~\cite{Low:2009di,Biekoetter:2014jwa,Pappadopulo:2014qza}.  For
these analyses the key property of new vector resonances are their SM
charges.  We analyse a massive vector field $V^a_\mu$ which is a
triplet under $SU(2)$, couples to a scalar and fermion currents, and
kinetically mixes with the weak gauge bosons of the Standard
Model~\cite{Pappadopulo:2014qza,Biekoetter:2014jwa}. The Lagrangian
includes the terms
%
\begin{alignat}{5} \lgr{} \supset& \, -
\dfrac{1}{4}\,V_{\mu\nu}^a\,V^{\mu\nu\, a} +
\dfrac{M_V^2}{2}\,V_\mu^a\,V^{\mu\,a} + i\,\frac{{g_V}}{2}
\,{\overline{c}_{H}}\,{V_{\mu}^a}\,\left[\phi^\dagger \sigma^a
\,\overleftrightarrow{D}^\mu\,\phi\,\right] +\dfrac{g_W^2}{2
{g_V}}\,{V_{\mu}^a}\,\sum_\text{fermions}\, {c_F}
\overline{F}_L\,\gamma^\mu\, \sigma^a \,F_L \notag \\
 %
 &+
\dfrac{{g_V}}{2}\,{c_{VVV}}\,\epsilon_{abc}\,V_\mu^a\,V_\nu^b\,D^{[\mu}V^{\nu]c}
+ {g_V}^2\,{c_{VVHH}}\,{V_{\mu}^a}\,V^{\mu a}\,\phisq\, -
\dfrac{g_W}{2}\,{c_{VVW}}\,\epsilon_{abc}\,W^{\mu\nu}\,V_\mu^b\,V_\nu^c
\,.
 \label{eq:validity_lag-vectortriplet}
\end{alignat}
%
The new field-strength tensor is $V_{\mu\nu}^a = D_\mu{V_{\nu}^a} -
D_\nu\,{V_{\mu}^a}$ and the covariant derivative acts on the triplet
as $D_\mu\,V_\nu^a = \partial_\mu\,V_\nu^a+{g_V}
\epsilon^{abc}\,V^b_\mu V_\nu^c$.  The coupling constant ${g_V}$ is
the characteristic strength of the heavy vector-mediated interactions,
while $g_W$ denotes the $SU(2)$ weak gauge coupling.  It will turn out
that $c_{VVW}$ and $c_{VVV}$ are irrelevant for Higgs phenomenology at
the LHC.  We give details of the model and the matching to the
corresponding EFT in Appendix~\ref{sec:validity_ap-triplet}.

The feature setting the vector triplet apart from the singlet,
doublet, and top partner models is that it directly affects the weak
gauge bosons.  The mixing of the new states with the $W$ and $Z$
bosons has two consequences: $i)$ a modification of the Higgs
couplings to SM particles, and $ii)$ new heavy states $\xi^0$,
$\xi^\pm$.

The definition of mass eigenstates from the heavy vector and the
SM-like gauge fields links the observable weak coupling $g$ and the
Lagrangian parameter $g_w$. For the coupling modifications this shift
in the gauge coupling and the direct heavy vector coupling to the
Higgs doublet combine to
%
\begin{align} \Delta_V &\approx \frac{g^2 c_F c_H}{4} \, \left(
\frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 - \frac{3 g_V^2 c_H^2}{8} \, \left(
\frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 \notag \\ \Delta_f &\approx \frac{g^2 c_F
c_H}{4} \, \left( \frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 - \frac{g_V^2 c_H^2}{8} \,
\left( \frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 \,.
\label{eq:validity_vector_decoup}
\end{align}
%
The contribution from the shift in the weak coupling is identical for
both coupling modifications.  In addition, contributions from virtual
heavy states $\xi$ modify the phase-space behaviour of Higgs signals in
many ways.

Just as for the 2HDM and the top partners, the mass matrix for the
massive vectors contains both the heavy scale $M_V$, which will
eventually become the matching scale, and terms proportional to some
power of $v$ multiplied by potentially large couplings. The new vector
states have roughly degenerate masses
%
\begin{align} \frac{m_\xi^2}{M_V^2} \approx 1 + g_V^2 c_{VVHH} \,
\left( \frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 + \frac{g_V^2 c_H^2}{4} \, \left(
\frac{v}{M_V} \right)^2 \,.
  \label{eq:validity_triplet_mxi_M}
\end{align}
%
Even if there appears to be a clear scale separation $M_V \gg v$,
large values of $g_V$, $c_{VVHH}$, or $c_H$ can change $m_\xi$
significantly and effectively induce a second mass scale.  Just as for
the top partners, a problem for the dimension-six approach arises from
virtual $\xi$ diagrams contributing for example to WBF Higgs
production. If $m_\xi < M_V \equiv \Lambda$ the lightest new particles
appearing in Higgs production processes have masses below the matching
scale of the linear representation.  The way out of a poor agreement
between the full model and its dimension-six description is again
switching to a $v$-improved matching in the broken phase with matching
scale $\Lambda = m_\xi$.

Integrating out the heavy vector triplet at tree level leaves us with
dimension-six Wilson coefficients
%
\begin{align} \bar{c}_{H} &=
\dfrac{3\,g^2\,v^2}{4\,M_V^2}\,\left[{\overline{c}_{H}}^2\dfrac{g_V^2}{g^2}
- 2\,{c_F}\,{\overline{c}_{H}}\right] &\bar{c}_{6} &=
\dfrac{g^2\,v^2}{M_V^2}\,\left[{\overline{c}_{H}}^2\dfrac{g_V^2}{g^2}
- 2\,{c_F}\,{\overline{c}_{H}} \right] \notag \\ \bar{c}_{f} &=
\dfrac{g^2\,v^2}{4\,M_V^2}\,\left[{\overline{c}_{H}}^2\dfrac{g_V^2}{g^2}
- 2\,{c_F}\,{\overline{c}_{H}} \right] &\bar{c}_{W} &= -
\dfrac{m_W^2}{M_V^2}\, {c_F}{\overline{c}_{H}} \,,
 \label{eq:validity_triplet_coefficients}
\end{align}
%
and four-fermion contributions that are irrelevant for Higgs physics.
Additional loop-induced contributions will be further suppressed and
do not add qualitatively new features, so we neglect them.  As in the
2HDM, we compare this default matching to an alternative $v$-improved
matching with matching scale $\Lambda = m_{\xi^0}$. The coefficients
in Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_triplet_coefficients} remain unchanged, except that
$M_V$ is replaced by $m_{\xi^0}$.

The main phenomenological features of this model reside in the
Higgs-gauge interactions. In the dimension-six description, these
modifications are mapped (amongst others) onto $\ope{W}$, which
induces momentum-dependent changes to the $hWW$ and $hZZ$
couplings. Therefore, our analysis focuses on WBF Higgs production and
Higgs-strahlung, where the intermediate $t$-channel and $s$-channel
gauge bosons can transfer large momenta.

As for the other models we study a set of benchmark points, defined in
Table~\ref{tab:validity_triplet_benchmarks} and Table~\ref{tab:validity_triplet_eft}.
Some of them are meant to emphasise the phenomenological possibilities
of the vector triplet model. For those we ignore experimental
constraints or parameter correlations from an underlying UV
completion:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[T1-2] All dimension-six EFT operators except for $\ope{W}$ vanish
along the line $c_H/c_F = 2 g^2/g_V^2$.  We aim for a large effect
only in the $hVV$ couplings.  The large couplings induce different
scales $M_V$ and $m_\xi$.
\item[T3] The sign in front of $\ope{W}$ changes on another line in
the $(c_H, c_F)$ space. The remaining operators do not vanish.
\item[T4] The vector triplet couplings and masses satisfy the leading
constraints from direct collider searches. For weak couplings (${g_V}
\leq 1$) resonances typically decaying to di-lepton and neutrino final
states have to stay above 3~TeV.  For the strongly interacting case
(${g_V} >1$) decays to di-bosons tend to exclude masses below
$1-1.5$~TeV~\cite{Pappadopulo:2014qza,Kaminska:2015ora}.
 \item[T5] A weakly coupled UV completion can be based on the gauge
group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times SU(2) \times
U(1)$~\cite{Barger:1980ti}, arising for instance from deconstructed
extra dimensions~\cite{ArkaniHamed:2001nc}. Its vector triplet
phenomenology is effectively described by the parameter $\alpha = g_V
/ \sqrt{g_V^2 - g_w^2}$ together with the symmetry breaking scale
$f$~\cite{Pappadopulo:2014qza},
%
 \begin{alignat}{3} M_V^2 &= \alpha^2 {g_V}^2 f^2 \,, & \qqquad
{\overline{c}_{H}} &= - \alpha \dfrac {g_W^2}{g_V^2} \,, & \qqquad
{c_{VVHH}} &= \alpha^2 \left[ \dfrac {g_W^4} {4g_V^4} \right] \,,
\notag \\ {c_F} &= - \alpha \,, & \qquad {c_{VVW}} &= 1 \,, & \qquad
{c_{VVV}} &= - \dfrac{\alpha^3}{g_V} \left[1 - \dfrac{3g_W^2}{g_V^2} +
\dfrac {2g_W^2} {g_V^4} \right] \,.
 \end{alignat}
\end{itemize}

Models known to challenge the dimension-six framework are modified gauge
sectors~\cite{gauge_modifications}, for example a vector triplet
extension~\cite{anke, too_long}. Its Lagrangian includes the terms
%

 \label{eq:validity_lag-vectortriplet}
\end{alignat}
%
The coupling constant $g_V$ is the characteristic strength of the
heavy vector-mediated interactions, while $g_w$ denotes the $SU(2)_L$
gauge coupling. After mixing they will combine to the observed weak
gauge coupling. This mixing of the new heavy states with the weak
bosons combined with the new, heavy resonances is what can lead to
large effects at the LHC.

Unlike in Ref.~\cite{too_long} we now define our dimension-six
Lagrangian in the HISZ basis~\cite{hisz}, to make our results
compatible with the \textsc{SFitter} Run~I legacy analysis of
Ref.~\cite{legacy}. The Higgs operators are defined in
Table~\ref{tab:validity_operators}. Our $v$-improved matching scale is
$\Lambda = m_{\xi^0}$ where $\xi^0$ is the neutral heavy particle
after mixing of the new $V$ state with the $Z$ boson. The dimension-six
Wilson coefficients for the triplet model read

Structurally, those dimension-six operators are of two
types,
%
\begin{align}
\ope{} \propto \frac{g^2 v^2}{\Lambda^2}
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\ope{} \propto \frac{g^2 \partial^2}{\Lambda^2} \; .
\label{eq:validity_operators}
\end{align}
%
The second type of operator, such as $\ope{WW}$, introduces a momentum
dependence in the $VVh$ interaction and thereby modifies kinematic
distributions in Higgs-strahlung and WBF Higgs production.  Problems
with our $v$-improved dimension-six approximation for LHC kinematics
typically occur through those operators. For two benchmark
points~\cite{too_long}, which challenge the agreement between full
model and dimension-six approximation, we give the Wilson coefficients
in Table~\ref{tab:validity_benchmarks}. The benchmark point T1 features
constructive interference between the dimension-six amplitudes and the
SM in weak boson fusion and destructive interference in $Vh$
production, while for T4 it is the other way around. In this paper we
will again study two particularly sensitive observables, the $m_{Vh}$
(or $p_{T,V}$) distribution in Higgs-strahlung and the $p_{T,j}$
distribution in weak boson fusion. In models with extended Higgs
sectors the $m_{hh}$ distribution in Higgs pair production would
develop very similar features, including an $s$-channel resonance, but
is experimentally less pressing~\cite{hh,too_long}.

  \label{tab:validity_triplet_rates}
\end{table}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_triplet_wbf} we show a set of kinematic distributions
in WBF Higgs production. In addition to the predictions of the full
vector triplet model and the matched EFT, we show distributions of the
vector triplet model without contributions from $\xi$ propagators.
The corresponding production cross section ratios between full vector
triplet model and EFT are given in Table~\ref{tab:validity_triplet_rates}.  For
the full model we observe a significant modification of the rate
relative to the Standard Model, especially towards large momentum
transfers. They can be traced to the $\xi$ fusion and mixed $W$-$\xi$
fusion diagrams, which increase strongly with energy. In comparison,
the modification of the $hWW$ coupling only leads to a relatively mild
rescaling.  These contributions from $\xi$ propagators can become
relevant already at energy scales well below $m_\xi$. The weak boson
virtualities inducing a momentum flow into the Higgs coupling are not
the only source of deviation from the Standard Model; the azimuthal
correlation between the tagging jets is well known to be sensitive to
the modified Lorentz structure of the $hWW$ vertex~\cite{phi_jj}.

Qualitatively, the dimension-six approach captures the features of the
full model, driven by $\ope{W}$.  In T1 and T2 a negative Wilson
coefficient yields a non-linear increase of the cross section with
energy. Conversely, the positive coefficient in T3 reduces the rate
with energy, eventually driving the combined amplitude through zero.

Comparing full and effective model for the more realistic benchmark
points T4 and T5 we see good agreement in the bulk of the
distribution.  The deviations from the Standard Model are captured by
the dimension-six operators, including the momentum dependence coming
from the $\xi$ diagrams. Only at very large momentum transfer the
validity of the EFT breaks down. For our realistic benchmark points
the LHC is likely not sensitive to these subtle effects.

In the more strongly coupled benchmark points T1\,--\,T3, the full
model predicts shifts in the jet distributions that are large enough
to be relevant for the upcoming LHC run. We find good agreement
between the full model and the default EFT only at low momentum
transfer, where the effects of new physics are small.  This naive
dimension-six approach loses its validity already around $p_{T,j}
\gtrsim 80$~GeV, a phase space region highly relevant for constraints
on new physics~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa}.\footnote{Note, however, that these
scenarios are already in tension with bounds from electroweak
precision observables, but we nevertheless show them to illustrate the
qualitative aspects of EFT breakdown.} This does not signal a
breakdown of the $E / \Lambda$ expansion, but a too large $c_i v^2 /
\Lambda^2$. It is linked to the difference between the scales $m_\xi$
and $M_V$ as given in Equation\,\eqref{eq:validity_triplet_mxi_M}, which the default
matching procedure is blind to.  Indeed, with the $v$-improved
matching the agreement is significantly better, and the dimension-six
description departs from the full model only at high energies,
$p_{T,j1} \gtrsim 300$~GeV.

  \label{fig:validity_triplet_vh}
\end{figure}
%-----------------------------------------------------------

The situation is similar in Higgs-strahlung, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_triplet_vh}.  In the full model the $\xi$ propagators
again dominate over the the modified $hWW$ interaction.  In addition,
the interference with the $\xi$-mediated diagrams leads to a
significant change of the rate and introduces a momentum dependence
already far below the actual resonance.  The relative sign of the
interference between $\xi$ amplitudes and SM-like diagrams is opposite
to that in WBF.

In the EFT the operator $\ope{W}$ induces the corresponding strong
energy dependence.  A positive Wilson coefficient leads to a
non-linear increase of the cross section with the energy scale, probed
by either $m_{Vh}$ or the $p_{T,V}$. A negative coefficient leads to a
decreasing amplitude with energy, including a sign flip. Like for the
full model, these $\ope{W}$ terms have the opposite effect on the rate
as in WBF.

The full and effective models agree relatively well in the more weakly
coupled benchmarks at low energies. In the realistic scenarios T4 and
T5, this agreement extends over the most relevant part of the phase
space, and the EFT successfully describes how the $\xi$ propagators
shift the Higgs-strahlung kinematics. With increasing energy,
momentum-dependent effects in both the full model (due to the
resonance) and the EFT (due to $\ope{W}$) become more relevant. While
the sign of the effect is the same in full model and EFT, the size and
energy dependence is different, and the EFT eventually fails to be a
good approximation. At even higher energies, the ``dips'' at different
energies in the full model and EFT as well as the $\xi$ resonance in
the full model mark the obvious failure of the effective theory.

For benchmark T1 to T3, where the effects are numerically much more
relevant for the LHC, the range of validity of the default EFT is
limited. The couplings are so large that in spite of a resonance mass
$m_\xi \sim 1$~TeV the dimension-six description already fails at
$m_{Vh} \gtrsim 220~\gev$.  Switching to the $v$-improved matching
again ameliorates the dimension-six approximation.  Even then, this
mismatch between full model and EFT is more pronounced in
Higgs-strahlung than in WBF, because $\xi$ contributions play a larger
role in these $s$-channel diagrams than in the $t$-channel WBF
amplitudes.

% In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_triplet_correlations} we again go beyond individual

% we assume vector triplet parameters in line with the benchmarks T1 and
% T2, and vary the heavy vector mass scale $M_V = 0.5 \dots 5$~TeV. The
% dimension-six coefficients are based on the default matching.

% The huge deviations in the WBF signal strength are due to the sizable
% momentum-dependent effects in the fusion process.  As discussed above,
% this behavior is poorly captured by the EFT for large vector

% differences are visible from the different trajectories in the

% offset from $\mu_{p,\gamma\gamma} = 1$ in the limit $M_V \gg v$ can be
% traced back to the non-decoupling $\xi^{\pm}$-mediated contribution to
% the $h\gamma\gamma$ loop.  The
% $\ord {{c_F}{\overline{c}_{H}}\,v^4/m_V^4 }$ contributions of dimension
% eight and higher are responsible for the additional upward enhancement
% of the fermion Yukawas in the full model, which is in particular
% visible for $\mu_{gg,\tau\tau}$, where the full model predictions
% systematically surpass the EFT. Finally, we find that an enhanced
% top-$W$ interference in $\Delta_\gamma$ pulls the full model
% $\gamma\gamma$ rates below the dimension-six-based predictions.  The
% accidental counterbalance of the higher dimension effects missing in
% the EFT explains the remarkable agreement with the full model for
% $\mu_{\text{ggF},\gamma\gamma}$.

Like the additional scalar models discussed before, the vector triplet
model offers regions in parameter space where the EFT works up to
large momentum transfer for realistic scenarios. It successfully
captures the virtual $\xi$ contributions in the momentum dependent
contribution from $\ope{W}$, but these numerical effects are small.
Relevant effects for the LHC occur if the separation of scales is
spoiled by large couplings or light new particles. In this case we
find substantial dimension-six departures from the full model
predictions for example in the bulk of the WBF distributions, which
typically further increase with the energy scale.  A modified
dimension-six description incorporating $v$-dependent effects improves
the EFT accuracy such that large deviations only occur in the
high-energy tails of distributions.

\subsection{To square or not to square}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If we accept that a dimension-six Lagrangian describing Higgs signatures
at the LHC is not necessarily part of a consistent effective field
theory, but rather a successful and reproducible parametrisation of
weakly interacting new physics, there exists no fundamental
motivation~\cite{legacy,too_long,mvh,gino,spanno} to include or to not
include the dimension-six squared term in
%
\begin{align}
|\mat_{4+6}|^2 = |\mat_4|^2 + 2 \, \text{Re} \mat_4^* \mat_6 \stackrel{?}{+} |\mat_6|^2 \; .
\end{align}
%
A dimension-six squared term of comparable or larger size than
the interference term can appear in phase-space regions with
a suppressed dimension-4 prediction, even when the EFT expansion in
$E/\Lambda$ holds and dimension-eight effects are negligible.
In the absence of any first-principle reason how to treat this term,
we need to test the different possibilities from a practical
perspective.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Higgs-strahlung}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We first analyse associated $Vh$ production with $V =
W^\pm, Z$ at 13~TeV LHC energy. To retain as much phase space as
possible we only consider the parton-level process
%
\begin{align}
  p p \to V h
\end{align}
%
simulated in \toolfont{MadGraph}~\cite{madgraph} without cuts or
decays. It is easy to see where in phase space the effective theory
breaks down: for on-shell outgoing Higgs and gauge bosons a large
momentum flow through the Higgs operator can only be generated through
the virtual $s$-channel propagator. We can directly test this in the
observable $m_{Vh}$ distribution, comparing the full model
with the dimension-six approach at large momentum flow.

We show the $m_{Vh}$ distributions in the left panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_VH}.  While theoretically the $m_{Vh}$
distribution is cleaner, for example when we include initial state
radiation, we can see the same effects in the highly correlated
$p_{T,V}$ distribution (right panels), due to the simple $2 \to 2$
signal kinematics~\cite{mvh,gino}.  The T1 benchmark point is constructed with a low
new physics scale and a destructive interference between Standard
Model and dimension-six term. We see that the squared dimension-six terms
are clearly needed to avoid negative cross sections in the high-energy
tails of the distributions. Driven by the light new particles,
inconsistencies otherwise occur around
%
\begin{align} 
m_{Vh} > 600~\gev \approx \frac{m_\xi^\text{(T1)} }2
\qquad \text{or} \qquad 
p_{T,V} > 300~\gev \approx \frac{m_\xi^\text{(T1)} }{4} \; ,
\label{eq:validity_breakdown_vh}
\end{align}
%
clearly within reach of Run~II. The reason why differences appear much
below $m_{Vh} = m_\xi$ is that the new states are wide and their pole
contribution extends through a large interference effect. Because for
this benchmark point the discrepancies signal the onset of a new
$s$-channel propagator pole, the agreement between full model and
dimension-six operators is limited and will hardly improve once we
include for example dimension-eight terms~\cite{kilian}.\footnote{We
  should note that if the LHC experiments should observe such a new
  resonance, the justification of a dimension-six description will most
  likely not be of experimental or theoretical concern.}

For the constructively interfering benchmark point T4 we observe no
dramatic effects in the tails, but the agreement between the full
model and the dimension-six approximation is improved when we include
these terms. Both benchmark points therefore suggest to include the
dimension-six squared terms in the LHC analysis, to improve the
agreement between the model and the dimension-six Lagrangian.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{WBF Higgs production}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Weak-boson-fusion Higgs production is a $2 \to 3$ process with two
$t$-channel gauge bosons carrying the momentum to the Higgs vertex.
The relevant kinematic variables are the two virtualities of the weak
bosons. Following many studies in the framework of the effective $W$
approximation~\cite{effective_w,polarized_ww} it is straightforward to
link them to the $p_T$ of the tagging jets, which even for multiple
jet radiation can be linked to the transverse momentum of the
Higgs~\cite{Buschmann:2014twa} (even though it is not clear if this
distribution is theoretically or experimentally favoured).  Again, we
start with the parton-level signal process
%
\begin{align}
u d \to u' d' h
\label{eq:validity_def_wbf}
\end{align}
%
with only one minimal cut $p_{T,j} > 20$~GeV for the two tagging jets.  We
show the results for the now constructively interfering benchmark
point T1 and the now destructively interfering benchmark point T4 in
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_WBF}. Negative event rates for T4 appear around
%
\begin{align}
p_{T,j_1} > 600~\gev \approx \frac{m_\xi^\text{(T4)}}{2} \; , 
\label{eq:validity_breakdown_wbf}
\end{align}
%
forcing us to either disregard the corresponding model hypothesis or
to add the dimension-six squared term.  For the less critical point T1
the agreement between the vector triplet model and its dimension-six
approximation including the squared terms extends well into the range
where deviations from the Standard Model become visible.

%------------------------------------------------------------


In the middle panels of Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_WBF} we see that indeed
the $p_{T,h}$ distribution looks almost identical to $p_{T,j_1}$. Both
of them can be traced back to the unobservable virtualities of the
weak bosons. Due to the preferred collinear direction of the
quark-vector splittings, the $W$-mediated and $Z$-mediated diagrams
populate very different parton-level phase-space regions, with
basically no interference between them.  We can thus define the
virtuality variable~\cite{gino,polarized_ww}
%
\begin{align}
  q =
  \begin{cases}
    \max\left(   \sqrt{ | (p_{u'} - p_{d})^2 | } \, , \, \sqrt{ | (p_{d'} - p_{u})^2 | }  \right) & \text{for $W$-like phase-space points,} \\
    \max\left(   \sqrt{ | (p_{u'} - p_{u})^2 | } \, , \, \sqrt{ | (p_{d'} - p_{d})^2 | }  \right)  & \text{for $Z$-like phase-space points,}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:validity_virt}
\end{align}
%
with the distribution shown in the bottom panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_WBF}. Comparing it to $p_{T,h}$ and $p_{T,j_1}$ we see
essentially the same behaviour.  The strong correlation of $q$ with
the observable transverse momenta of the leading tagging jet and the
Higgs is explicitly shown in Figure~\ref{fig:validity_virt_corr}.

Finally, we compare expected exclusion limits on the vector triplet in
the absence of a signal, based on the full model vs the dimension-six
approach.  For the process shown in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_def_wbf} we
multiply the cross sections with a branching ratio
$\br(h \to 2\ell 2\nu) \approx 0.01$.  We disregard non-Higgs
backgrounds as well as parton-shower or detector effects.  We then
count events in two high-energy bins of the $p_{T,j_1}$ distributions,
defining a parameter point to be excluded if $S/\sqrt{S+B} > 2$.
While this statistical analysis is not designed to be realistic, it
illustrates how the validity of our dimension-six approach affects
possible limits.  For our limit setting procedure we choose a
two-dimensional plane defined by $m_\xi$ versus a universal coupling
rescaling $c$,
%
\begin{align}
  g_V = 1 \; , \qqquad 
  c_H = c \; , \qqquad 
  c_F = \frac {g_V^2}{2g^2} \, c \; , \qqquad 
  c_{HHVV} = c^2 \; .
\end{align}
%
This reduces the list of generated dimension-six operators to
%
\begin{align}
  f_{WW} = f_{BW} = \frac {c^2} {2g^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad  f_W = - \frac {c^2} {g^2} \,,
\end{align}
%
and all dimension-six deviations scale like $c^2/m_\xi^2$. To avoid
effects from strongly interacting theories we limit our analysis to
$\Gamma_{\xi}/m_{\xi} < 1/4$.

In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:validity_limits} we see that based on event
numbers in the range $150~\text{GeV} < p_{T,j_1} < 300~\text{GeV}$,
the dimension-six approximation with the squared terms gives the
same limits as the full model, as long as we ensure that the new
resonance remains narrow.  In the high-energy tail
$p_{T,j_1} > 300$~GeV including the squared terms also improves the validity of
the dimension-six approach, but it only leads to identical limits for
large $m_\xi$, combined with strong couplings. Indeed, limiting the
momentum transfer of events for example through an upper limit on
$p_{T,j}$ is well known to reduce the dependence on model
assumptions~\cite{spins1,spins2}.

Just as for the $Vh$ production process, at least as long as the event
numbers remain small the square of the dimension-six operators always
improves the agreement with the full theory in weak boson fusion. With
improved statistics the differences become smaller and ultimately
negligible, and the question of whether the squared dimension-six
amplitudes should be taken into account is rendered irrelevant.

  \label{fig:validity_realistic_jets}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------------------------------------

Before we attempt to further improve the description of the full vector
triplet model for example in the benchmark point T1, we briefly test
if the parton-level effects described above survive a realistic environment.
We add a parton shower and jet reconstruction now for the full
process
%
\begin{align}
  p p \to h \; j j \, (+j) \; ,
\end{align}
%
simulated in \toolfont{MadGraph}~\cite{madgraph}.  Parton showering is
performed by \toolfont{PYTHIA6}~\cite{pythia} using the $k_T$-jet MLM
matching scheme~\cite{mlm} with a minimum $k_T$ jet measure between
partons of \toolfont{xqcut}=20~GeV. \toolfont{Fastjet}~\cite{fastjet}
is used to construct jets based on the $k_T$ algorithm with $R = 0.4$. We do not
include a Higgs decay because we are only interested in
production-side kinematics.  The standard WBF cuts then are
%
\begin{align}
  p_{T,j} > 20~\gev \,, \qqquad 
  m_{jj} > 500~\gev \,, \qqquad 
  \Delta \eta_{jj}~>~3.6
\label{eq:validity_wbf_cuts}
\end{align}
%
on the two hardest jets. We veto additional jets with
$p_{T,j} > 20$~GeV between these two tagging jets.  To analyse the
effects of the $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ cut~\cite{spins2}, we generate
additional samples explicitly excluding Higgs-strahlung diagrams, in
spite of the fact that it might break gauge invariance.

In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_realistic_jets} we show that the distributions are
generally robust under parton shower and jet reconstruction, but two
complications arise.  First, on-shell $\xi$ production contributes to
this process and is not entirely removed by the WBF cuts in
Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_wbf_cuts}, leading to visible differences between the
full and effective model already at low momenta. Such a resonance peak
would be easy to identify experimentally and does not present a major
problem for the dimension-six approximation.

Second, the tension between the full model and the dimension-six
approximation at large momenta now remains below $10~\%$.  This means
that the $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ cut not only removes large contributions
from Higgs-strahlung--like diagrams, it also gets rid of phase-space
regions where the full model and the dimension-six description differ
the most.  At the same time, the $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ removes some of
its well-known discrimination power for new physics effects versus the
Standard Model~\cite{spins2}.

\subsection{Towards a simplified model}
\label{sec:validity_simplified}

  \caption{Normalised WBF distributions of the tagging jets. We separate
    the squared new-physics amplitudes, shown as solid lines, from the
    interference with the SM-like diagrams (dashed).}
  \label{fig:validity_squared_separate}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------------------------------------

In the first part of the paper we have shown where in phase space a
dimension-six description of LHC observables breaks down, both for $Vh$
production and for weak boson fusion. For $Vh$ production with its
simple $2 \to 2$ kinematics problems are clearly linked to a possible
$s$-channel resonance, as seen in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_breakdown_vh}.  For
weak boson fusion there appears no resonance, but the result of
Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_breakdown_wbf} suggests that the new states in the
$t$-channel have a similar effect.  In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_separate}
we show different tagging jet distributions, separating the Feynman
diagrams including the heavy $\xi$ states. In particular for the
critical $p_{T,j_1}$ distribution, the $\Delta \eta_{jj}$
distribution, and the $\Delta \phi_{jj}$ distribution these diagrams
are only very poorly described by the dimension-six approach. In
practice this is not a problem because these contributions are
strongly suppressed by the heavy mass $m_\xi$, but it poses the
question how we can improve the agreement. The obvious solution to
these problems in the $s$-channel of $Vh$ production and in the
$t$-channel of weak boson fusion is a simplified
model~\cite{simp,simp_higgs}. A new vector field mixing with the weak
bosons as described by the Lagrangian shown in
Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_lag-vectortriplet} is such a simplified model, but its
structure is still relatively complex. Obviously, an additional heavy
scalar with mass around $m_\xi$ and the appropriate couplings will
improve the $2 \to 2$ kinematics for $Vh$ production. The question we
want to study in this section is if such a scalar can also improve the
weak boson fusion kinematics.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{A pseudo-scalar as a simplified vector}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The simplest simplified model we can write down includes one new
massive scalar $S$ with a Higgs portal and a Yukawa coupling. 
However, a scalar state will not interfere with the Standard Model
diagrams. In analogy to the CP properties of the Goldstone mode
contributing to the massive $Z$ boson we define our simplified model
with a pseudo-scalar state as
%
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} \supset 
  \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu S)^2 
- \frac{m_S}{2} S^2 
+ \sum_\text{fermions} g_F \; S \overline{F} \gamma_5 F 
+ g_S \; S^2 \phi^\dagger \phi \,.
  \label{eq:validity_simplified_model}
\end{align}

%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=0.43\textwidth]{fig/validity/WBF_simplified_j1pt.pdf}
  \hspace*{0.05\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.43\textwidth]{fig/validity/WBF_simplified_Hpt.pdf} \\

  \caption{Normalised WBF distributions for a scalar simplified model
    defined in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_simplified_model} vs the vector triplet
    benchmark.}
  \label{fig:validity_simplified}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------------------------------------

In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_simplified} we show the same WBF distributions as in
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_separate}, but including the simplified scalar
model. For the $p_{T,j}$ distribution the squared new-physics
amplitudes in the full vector model and the simplified scalar model
indeed agree well, improving upon the dimension-six description which
breaks down in this distribution.  However, the interference term with
the Standard Model, which is numerically dominant for most of the
distribution and well described in the dimension-six model, poses a
problem.  The $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ distributions show even poorer
agreement: the spin-1 amplitudes of the Standard Model and the vector
triplet have similar phase-space distributions and give two forward
tagging jets, while the scalar mediator favours central
jets~\cite{spins2}.  The $\Delta \phi_{jj}$ distribution, known to be
sensitive to the tensor structure of the hard $VVh$
interaction~\cite{delta_phi}, exposes similar differences between the
full and simplified model.  Altogether, our simplified scalar model
with its very different $VVh$ interaction structure does improve the
description in the region where the dimension-six approach breaks down,
but it fails to describe interference patterns and angular
correlations of the tagging jets.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Splitting functions and equivalence theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We can understand this very different behaviour of the scalar
$t$-channel mediator as compared to the vector from the splitting
kernels in the collinear limit.  The matrix element squared for the
weak boson fusion process mediated by pseudo-scalars $S$ has the form
%
\begin{align}
 | \mathcal{M}(qq \to q'q'h) |^2 \propto 
  \frac{g_F^4 \;  t_1 t_2}{(t_1 - m_S^2)^2 \; (t_2 - m_S^2)^2} 
\stackrel{m_S \to 0}{\longrightarrow} \frac{\text{const}}{t_1 t_2} \; ,
\end{align}
%
where $t_1$ and $t_2$ denote the respective momentum flow through each
scalar propagator. For $m_S \to 0$ the Jacobians from the phase-space
integration cancel a possible collinear divergence, while for a light
vector boson a soft and a collinear divergence remains. Unlike in the
usual WBF process, the tagging jets in our simplified scalar model
will not be forward.  The reason for this difference in the
infrared is the (pseudo-)scalar coupling to quarks: since the scalar
carries no Lorentz index, a $q \to q S$ splitting will be expressed in
terms of the momentum combinations $(p_q p_q')$, $p_q^2 = m_q^2$, and
$p_q'^2 = m_q^2$. In the limit of massless quarks only the first term
remains as $t = 2 (p_q p_q')$.  This factor in the numerator cancels
the apparent divergence of the $t$-channel propagator.

Adding higher-dimensional couplings of the (pseudo-)scalar to
fermions, such as
%
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L} \supset 
\sum_\text{fermions} \Biggl[  
  g_{F,2} S \overline{F} F 
+ g_{F,3} (\partial_\mu S) \overline{F} \gamma^\mu F
+ g_{F,4} S (\partial_\mu S) \overline{F} \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 F 
+ g_{F,5} S (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu S) \overline{F} [\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu] F
\Biggr] \; ,
\label{eq:validity_simplified_model_extended}
\end{align}
%
does not change this result qualitatively. After partial integration
and using the Dirac equation for the on-shell quarks the coupling
$g_{F,3}$ is equivalent to the simple scalar coupling, $g_{F,2} = m_q^2
g_{F,3}$. In the limit of massless quarks, only two of the new
structures listed in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_simplified_model_extended}
contribute at all: $g_{F,2}$ gives exactly the same result as $g_F$,
while $g_{F,5}$ leads to even higher powers of $t$ in the numerator,
%
\begin{align}
  | \mathcal{M}(qq \to q'q'h) |^2 \propto 
  \frac{g_{F,5}^4 \; t_1^3 t_2^3}{(t_1 - m_s^2)^2 \; (t_2 - m_s^2)^2} \; . 
\end{align}
%
No matter how we couple the (pseudo-)scalar of the simplified model to
the external quarks, it never reproduces the collinear splitting
kernel of a vector boson.

To be a little more precise, we can write out the spin-averaged matrix
element squared for the $q \to q' S$ splitting in terms of the energy
of the initial quark $E$, the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$, and
the transverse momentum $p_T$, both carried by $S$,
%
\begin{align}
 | \mathcal{M}(q \to q'S) |^2 &= - 2 g_F^2 x m_q^2
                     + 2 g_F^2 E^2 (1-x)
                     \Biggl[ \sqrt{1 + \frac {p_T^2} {E^2 (1-x)^2} + \frac {m_q^2 (1 - (1-x)^2)} {E^2 (1-x)^2} } - 1 \Biggr] \notag \\
                   &= g_F^2 \, \frac {x^2 \, m_q^2} {1-x} 
                     + g_F^2 \,  \frac {p_T^2} {1-x} 
                     + \ord { \frac{m_q^2 p_T^2}{E^2}, \frac{m_q^4}{E^2}, \frac{p_T^4}{E^2} } \;.
\label{eq:validity_splitting_s}
\end{align}
%
From Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_splitting_s} one can derive an effective Higgs
approximation or \emph{effective scalar
  approximation}~\cite{effective_scalar}: in the collinear and
high-energy limit, a process $q X \to q' Y$ mediated by a
(pseudo-)scalar $S$ is described by
%
\begin{align}
  \sigma (qX \to q'Y) = \int \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d} p_T \, F_S(x,p_T)
  \, \sigma (SX \to Y)
\label{eq:validity_def_splitting}
\end{align}
%
with the splitting function
%
\begin{align}
  F_S(x,p_T) &= \frac {g_F^2} {16 \pi^2} \, 
               \frac {x \, p_T^3} {\left( m_S^2 (1-x) + p_T^2 \right)^2} \,.
\label{eq:validity_kernel_s}
\end{align}
%
Unlike for vector emission, there is no soft divergence for $x \to 0$.
The $p_T$ dependence is the same as for transverse vector
bosons~\cite{effective_w,polarized_ww}, as we discuss in some detail in the
appendix. 

It might seem surprising that our pseudo-scalar is emitted with a
fundamentally different phase-space dependence than longitudinal $W$
and $Z$ bosons, in apparent contradiction of the Goldstone boson
equivalence theorem.  However, the latter only makes a statement about
the leading term in an expansion in $m_W / E$, where 
$\varepsilon^\mu_L \sim p^\mu / m_W$. At this order the squared matrix
element for the splitting $q \to q' W_L$ agrees with the pseudo-scalar
result, but is suppressed by a factor of $m_q^2 / E^2$. Higher orders
in the $m_W/E$ expansion, outside the validity range of the
equivalence theorem, are not suppressed by quark masses.  The
equivalence theorem is therefore of very limited use in describing the
$W$ or $Z$ couplings to quarks except the top.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Sec.~\ref{sec:validity_simplified} we have introduced a pseudo-scalar in the
$t$-channel of weak boson fusion to describe some of the features
which we find in the full vector triplet model and which our
dimension-six description does not describe well. In this appendix we
collect some of the main formulas and compare the kinematics of
fermions radiating scalars, transverse, or longitudinal gauge
bosons. Our formalism follows the effective
$W$ approximation~\cite{effective_w} as well as the effective Higgs
approximation~\cite{effective_scalar} and allows us to analytically
describe the soft and collinear behaviour. If we do not need to
describe interference terms with SM gauge bosons we can start with a
CP-even scalar splitting $q \to qS$, in terms of the energy of the
initial quark $E$, the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$, carried by $S$, and the
scalar's transverse momentum $p_T$:
%
\begin{align}
 | \mathcal{M}(q \to q'S)  |^2 &= 2 g_F^2 (2-x) m_q^2
                     + 2 g_F^2 E^2 (1-x)
                     \Biggl[ \sqrt{1 + \frac {p_T^2} {E^2 (1-x)^2} + \frac {m_q^2 (1 - (1-x)^2)} {E^2 (1-x)^2} } 
                       - 1 \Biggr] \notag \\
                   &= g_F^2 \left( 4  + \frac {x^2} {1-x} \right) m_q^2
                     + g_F^2 \, \frac {p_T^2} {1-x} 
                     + \ord {\frac{m_q^2 p_T^2}{E^2}, \frac{m_q^4}{E^2}, \frac{p_T^4}{E^2} } \; .
\end{align}
%
The main feature of this splitting is that the infrared behaviour is
different for the term proportional to the quark mass and for the
surviving term in the realistic limit $m_q \to 0$: in the absence of a
fermion mass the collinear divergence from a $t$-channel propagator is
cancelled by the coupling structure. If the term proportional to $m_q$
dominates there will be the usual collinear divergence once we include
a scalar propagator. For a pseudo-scalar the structure shown in
Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_splitting_s} is very similar,
%
\begin{align}
 |\mathcal{M}(q \to q'S)  |^2 &= - 2 g_F^2 x m_q^2
                     + 2 g_F^2 E^2 (1-x)
                     \Biggl[ \sqrt{1 + \frac {p_T^2} {E^2 (1-x)^2} + \frac {m_q^2 (1 - (1-x)^2)} {E^2 (1-x)^2} } 
                                - 1 \Biggr] \notag \\
                   &= g_F^2 \, \frac {x^2 \, m_q^2} {1-x} 
                     + g_F^2 \,  \frac {p_T^2} {1-x} 
                     + \ord {\frac{m_q^2 p_T^2}{E^2}, \frac{m_q^4}{E^2}, \frac{p_T^4}{E^2} } \;.
\end{align}

In the limit $m_q \to 0$ we can compute universal splitting kernels
including only the leading term in $p_T$, as defined in
Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_def_splitting}.  Obviously, the scalar and pseudoscalar
case given in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_kernel_s} are identical, and we can compare
them with the splitting kernels for longitudinal or transverse
$W$ bosons~\cite{effective_w},
%
\begin{align}
  F_S(x,p_T) &= \frac {g_F^2} {16 \pi^2} \, x \,
               \frac {p_T^3} {\left( m_S^2 (1-x) + p_T^2 \right)^2} \,,\notag \\
  F_T(x,p_T) &= \frac {g^2} {16 \pi^2} \, \frac {1+(1-x)^2} x \, \frac {p_T^3} {\left( m_W^2 (1-x) + p_T^2 \right)^2} \,, \notag \\
  F_L(x,p_T) &= \frac {g^2} {16 \pi^2} \, \frac {(1-x)^2} x \, \frac {2 m_W^2 \, p_T} {\left( m_W^2 (1-x) + p_T^2 \right)^2} \,.
  \label{eq:validity_splittings}
\end{align}

In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_effective_scalar} we show how these different
splittings translate into WBF distributions and compare full simulations
in \toolfont{MadGraph} to the predictions of Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_splittings}.
A heavy Higgs, $m_h = 1$~TeV, is needed to guarantee a large energy scale
$E \sim m_h \gg p_T \sim m_W, m_S$. In this case we find that the
effective scalar approximation quite accurately describes the transverse
momentum distribution of the tagging jets. For $m_h = 125$~GeV the
assumption of on-shell $W$ bosons or scalars breaks down and the
effective descriptions lose their validity.

    cross section of at least 20~fb.}
  \label{fig:validity_cuts}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------------------------------------

Now that it is clear that we cannot further improve the agreement
between the vector triplet and its dimension-six approximation by adding
a heavy scalar as a simplified model, we go back to the original
problem: how can we best use the dimension-six approximation for limit
setting, and do the shortcomings shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:validity_squared_separate} harm this approach?

We know that in our LHC analysis we should avoid angular correlations
of the tagging jets, like $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ or $\Delta
\phi_{jj}$. Instead, we can use momentum-related kinematic variables
like
%
\begin{align}
 x \in \left\{  q, \, p_{T,j_1}, \, p_{T,j_2}, \, p_{T,h} \right\} \; .
\label{eq:validity_variables}
\end{align}
%
An acceptance cut $x > x_\text{min}$ on any of those variables
projects out the interesting phase-space regions, while the cut $x <
x_\text{max}$ ensures the validity of an effective theory
description. If $x_\text{min} > x_\text{max}$ the dimension-six
description is not useful. For each window $x_\text{min,max}$ we can
compute the contribution to the theoretical uncertainty
%
\begin{align}
  \Delta_\text{theo} (x_\text{min,max}) 
= \left| \frac {\sigma_\text{D6} - \sigma_\text{full}} {\sigma_\text{full}} \right| \; ,
\label{eq:validity_err_th}
\end{align} 
%
as well as the statistics-driven and systematics-driven significances
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{S}{B} (x_\text{min,max}) 
= \left| \frac {\sigma_\text{full} - \sigma_\text{SM}} {\sigma_\text{SM}} \right| 
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
  \frac{S}{\sqrt{B}} (x_\text{min,max}) 
= \sqrt{L} \, \left| \frac {\sigma_\text{full} - \sigma_\text{SM}} {\sqrt{\sigma_\text{SM}}} \right| \; ,
\label{eq:validity_err_ex}
\end{align}
%
where $L = 30~\ifb$ is used as a toy number.

The question is for which
observable $x$ we find the largest $S/B$ and $S/\sqrt{B}$ values while
keeping $\Delta_\text{theo}$ small.  In Figure~\ref{fig:validity_cuts} we show
the correlations between theoretical uncertainty and experimental
reach for the variables defined in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_variables} for a
parton-level analysis as defined in Equation\;\eqref{eq:validity_def_wbf}. We see
that the momentum transfer $q$ or the leading tagging jet's
$p_{T,j_1}$ lead to the envelopes with the highest significance for a
given theoretical uncertainty $\Delta_\text{theo}$. This indicates
that the leading tagging jet's transverse momentum is the best way of
experimentally accessing the momentum flow through the hard process,
at least for the hard parton-level process with only two tagging
jets.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:validity_conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An effective field theory for the Higgs sector offers a theoretically
well-defined, efficient, and largely model-independent language to
analyse extensions of the Standard Model in both rate measurements and
kinematic distributions. A fit of dimension-six operators to LHC Higgs
measurements works fine~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa} and constitutes the
natural extension of the Higgs couplings analyses of Run~I.  Most of
the relevant higher-dimensional operators correspond to simple
coupling modifications, supplemented by four operators describing new
Lorentz structures in the Higgs coupling to weak
bosons~\cite{Corbett:2015ksa}.

In this paper we have studied the validity of this approach from the
theoretical side.  We know that at the LHC a clear hierarchy of
electroweak and new physics scales cannot be guaranteed, the question
is whether dimension-six operators nevertheless capture the
phenomenology of specific UV-complete theories with sufficient
accuracy.  We have systematically compared a singlet Higgs portal
model, a two-Higgs doublet model, scalar top partners, and a heavy
vector triplet to their dimension-six EFT descriptions, based on the
linear realisation of electroweak symmetry breaking with a Higgs
doublet.  We have analysed the main Higgs production and decay
signatures, covering rates as well as kinematic distributions.

We have found that the dimension-six operators provide an adequate
description in almost all realistic weakly coupled scenarios. Shifts
in the total rates are well described by effective operators.
Kinematic distributions typically do not probe weakly interacting new
physics with sufficient precision in the high-energy tails to
challenge the effective operator ansatz.  This is obvious for the
extended scalar models, where new Lorentz structures and
momentum-dependent couplings with dramatic effects in LHC
distributions only appear at the loop level.  A loop-suppressed
effective scale suppression $E^2/(4 \pi \Lambda)^2$ has to be compared
with on-shell couplings modifications proportional to $v^2/\Lambda^2$.
Only phase space regions probing energies around $4 \pi v \approx
3$~TeV significantly constrain loop contributions in the Higgs sector
and eventually lead to breakdown of the effective field theory. In
turn, a simple dimension-six descriptions will capture all effects that
are expected to be measurable with sufficient statistics at the LHC
Run II.  On the other hand, the vector triplet model shows that
modifications of the gauge sector can generate effects in LHC
kinematics at tree level. However, we again find that for weakly
interacting models and phenomenologically viable benchmark points they
are described well by an appropriate set of dimension-six
operators.

Three sources for a possible breakdown of the dimension-six description
are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:validity_differences}\footnote{Forcing the EFT
approach into a spectacular breakdown was the original aim of this
paper, but to our surprise this did not happen.}: First, the EFT
cannot describe light new resonances. Such a signature at the LHC
would be an obvious signal to stop using the EFT and switch to
appropriate simplified models.  Second, selected kinematic
distributions fail to be described by the dimension-six Lagrangian, in
particular for Higgs pair production.  Deviations in the high-energy
tails of WBF and Higgs-strahlung distributions on the other hand are
too small to be relevant in realistic weakly coupled scenarios. These
two cases do not threaten LHC analyses in practice.

The third issue with the dimension-six EFT description is linked to
matching in the absence of a well-defined scale hierarchy.  Even with
only one heavy mass scale in the Lagrangian, the electroweak VEV
together with large couplings can generate several new physics scales,
defined by the masses of the new particles.  A linear EFT description,
which is justified by the SM-like properties of the newly discovered
Higgs boson, should in principle be matched in the phase where the
electroweak symmetry is unbroken. Such a procedure is blind to
additional scales induced by the electroweak VEV, potentially leading
to large errors in the dimension-six approximation.  Including
$v$-dependent terms in the Wilson coefficients, which corresponds to
matching in the broken phase, can significantly improve the EFT
performance. We have explicitly demonstrated this for all the models
considered in this paper.

None of these complications with the dimension-six description presents
a problem in using effective operators to fit LHC Higgs data.  They
are purely theoretical issues that need to be considered for the
interpretation of the results.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While a dimension-six Higgs analysis at the LHC cannot be considered the
leading part of a consistent effective theory, it describes the
effects of weakly interacting extensions of the Higgs-gauge sector very
well~\cite{too_long}. In this brief study we have answered two practical
question concerning such a dimension-six analysis for Run~II.

First, a priori it is not clear if squared dimension-six terms should be
included in calculations. We have studied two particularly challenging
parameter points of a vector triplet model for $Vh$ production and for
weak-boson-fusion Higgs production. For both processes we find that
the dimension-six squared term avoids negative rate predictions in the
$m_{Vh}$ or $p_{T,V}$ distributions of $Vh$ production and in the
$p_{T,j_1}$ distribution of weak boson fusion. Even for cases with a
constructive interference between the dimension-six and the Standard
Model contributions, it turns out that including the dimension-six
squared term improves the agreement of kinematic distributions between
the full model and the dimension-six approximation. Ultimately, this
translates into a better agreement in the expected exclusion
limits\footnote{Similar conclusions in a different framework have recently
been published in Ref.~\cite{gino}.}.

Second, we have attempted to improve the agreement between the full
model and our approximation by using a simplified model. The only
significantly simpler model than a mixing gauge extension is an
extended scalar sector. While the corresponding deviations between the
full model and the dimension-six approximation are phenomenologically
hardly relevant, we find that such an additional scalar improves the
modelling of kinematic distributions of the kind $m_{Vh}$ and
$p_{T,j_1}$ where the dimension-six description breaks down. However,
this comes at the cost of significant deviations in the dominant
interference terms. Moreover, once we include angular correlations
like $\Delta \eta_{jj}$ or $\Delta \phi_{jj}$ in weak boson fusion,
the simplified model fails badly. The difference can be traced to the
divergence structure of the corresponding splittings.

Seeing that the dimension-six approach is still the better simple model
to describe new physics in WBF distributions, we have finally analysed
which phase-space regions provide an interesting window to new physics
while being well described by the dimension-six approximation.  We have
demonstrated that the leading tagging jet's $p_T$ distribution is
particularly suited for such a search for new physics.
