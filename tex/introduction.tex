\firstword{T}{he Higgs boson}~\cite{Higgs:1964ia, Higgs:1964pj,
  Englert:1964et} is a key element of the Standard Model of particle
physics (SM)~\cite{Glashow:1961tr, Weinberg:1967tq, Salam:1968rm}. Its
discovery in 2012~\cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012xdj} completed the
particle zoo of the SM. It is a triumph of a decade-old model, but it
also offers us a way forward: the Higgs provides us with an
unprecedented chance to understand some of the biggest unsolved
mysteries of physics.

As the only known fundamental scalar, it suffers from the famous
electroweak hierarchy problem: why is its mass scale (and therefore
the electroweak scale) so much smaller than the Planck scale, while
there is no sign of a symmetry protecting it against quantum
corrections? Is the electroweak vacuum, defined by the Higgs
potential, stable?  Why are the Yukawa couplings, and consequently the
fermion masses, spread out over so many orders of magnitude?  Is the
Higgs related to Dark Matter, for instance as mediator to a dark
sector? Or might it even be the source of inflation, explaining the
surprising level of isotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background?

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model have been proposed to
answer at least some of these questions. Very often they predict Higgs
coupling patterns different from the SM. A precise measurement of the
Higgs properties thus provides a crucial probe of such models, and
might be one of the most important missions for present and future
runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

This poses two immediate questions:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which framework should be used to parametrise the Higgs
  properties?
\item How can these parameters be measured efficiently at the LHC
  experiments?
\end{enumerate}
%
These two questions drive the research presented in this thesis, and
we will address them one by one.

\newparagraph

Ideally, all Higgs measurements should use the same universal language
to parametrise their results, allowing for an efficient comparison
and combination. Such a framework should be general enough to describe
the effects of any interesting new physics scenario without strong model
assumptions. On the other hand, too large a number of parameters makes
combinations of different experiments and global fits impractical.

A simple example for such a universal parametrisation that was widely
used during run~1 of the LHC is the $\kappa$ framework. It is based on
the SM Lagrangian, but promotes all Higgs couplings to free
parameters. The main limitation of this approach is that it can only
describe structures that are already present in the SM. So while a
measurement based on the $\kappa$ framework can be useful for total
rates, it will not be able to utilise information in kinematic
distributions.

Instead, we follow an approach based on effective field theory
(EFT)~\cite{Coleman:1969sm, Callan:1969sn, Weinberg:1980wa}. Based
only on the assumption that new physics has a typical energy scale
significantly larger than the experimental energies, all new physics
effects are captured by a tower of higher-dimensional operators. The
leading effects for Higgs physics should come from only a handful of
operators with mass dimension six~\cite{Burges:1983zg, Leung:1984ni,
  Buchmuller:1985jz}. These operators
%
% are manifestly gauge-invariant and can be used beyond tree
% level. They
%
describe both coupling rescalings as well as novel kinematic
structures not present in the SM, allowing us to access information in
distributions in addition to total rates~\cite{Corbett:2012ja,
  Corbett:2015ksa}. Effective operators also let us combine Higgs data
with results from other experiments, including electroweak precision
data or gauge boson production at the
LHC~\cite{Butter:2016cvz}. However, the limited precision of the LHC
Higgs measurements means that only models that are either strongly
coupled or relatively light can be probed. In the latter case, the
characteristic energy scale of new physics is not sufficiently
separated from the momentum transfers in the experiments, casting
doubt on the validity of the EFT approach.

We analyse the usefulness of higher-dimensional operators at the LHC
by comparing the predictions of UV-complete scenarios of new physics
to their dimension-six approximations~\cite{Brehmer:2015rna}. Our
analysis covers additional scalar singlets, two-Higgs-doublet models,
scalar top partners, and heavy vector bosons, focusing on parameter
ranges that the LHC will be sensitive to. We take into account rates
and distributions in the most important Higgs production modes and
various representative decay channels as well as Higgs pair
production. For this array of models, benchmark points, and
observables, we ask if and where the effective description of new
physics breaks down, and how it can be improved.

As it turns out, the performance of the effective model strongly
depends on the matching procedure that links the coefficients of the
dimension-six operators to the full theory. We analyse how electroweak
symmetry breaking affect the validity of the effective theory, and
discuss how the standard matching procedure can be adapted to
situations where these effects are large. In addition, we discuss the
practical problems whether squared amplitudes from dimension-six
operators should be included in calculations, and which observables
provide the best probes of the momentum transfer in Higgs production
in weak boson fusion~\cite{Biekotter:2016ecg}.

\newparagraph
%
After choosing a parametrisation of Higgs properties, the next
question is how its parameters can be measured most efficiently. Higgs
measurements are affected by many different operators, and each of
them affects different couplings, typically introducing non-trivial
kinematic structures. This leads to a complicated relation between the
high-dimensional model parameter space and often also high-dimensional
phase spaces.

Traditional analyses based on selection cuts and histograms of
kinematic observables are in many cases not sensitive to such subtle
signatures.  At the other end of the spectrum, experiments resort more
and more to high-level statistical tools, including machine learning
techniques~\cite{Cranmer:2015bka, Louppe:2016ylz, Louppe:2016aov,
  Cranmer:2016lzt, Baldi:2016fzo, Brehmer:ghost_probability,
  Cogan:2014oua, Baldi:2014pta, deOliveira:2015xxd, Almeida:2015jua,
  Baldi:2016fql, Guest:2016iqz, Komiske:2016rsd, Kasieczka:2017nvn,
  Louppe:2017ipp, Baldi:2014kfa, Searcy:2015apa, Santos:2016kno,
  Alves:2016htj, Buckley:2011kc, Bornhauser:2013aya, Bechtle:2017vyu}
or matrix-element-based methods~\cite{Kondo:1988yd, Abazov:2004cs,
  Gao:2010qx, Alwall:2010cq, Avery:2012um, Andersen:2012kn,
  Campbell:2013hz, Artoisenet:2013vfa, Martini:2015fsa,
  Gritsan:2016hjl, Soper:2011cr, Soper:2012pb, Soper:2014rya,
  Atwood:1991ka, Davier:1992nw, Diehl:1993br}. While these
multivariate techniques are powerful, it is often not transparent
which physical properties they probe. It is therefore increasingly
important to be able to characterise the information contained in LHC
signatures.

We use information geometry to understand and optimise Higgs
measurements~\cite{Brehmer:2016nyr}.  The central building block is
the Fisher information matrix, which according to the Cram\'er-Rao
bound encodes the maximal knowledge on theory parameters we can derive
from an experiment. Unlike many other statistical tools, the Fisher
information is intrinsically designed for continuous, high-dimensional
parameter spaces. This approach does not require any discretisation of
the theory space and leads to results that do not depend on arbitrary
parameter or basis choices. In addition, the Fisher information
defines a metric on the model parameter space. This not only provides
an intuitive geometric picture of the sensitivity of measurements, but
also allows us to track the impact of higher orders in the EFT
expansion.

We calculate the Fisher information for Higgs production in weak boson
fusion with decays into tau pairs and four leptons, and for Higgs
production in association with a single top quark. To this end, we
develop an algorithm to calculate the Fisher information in
particle-physics observables based on Monte-Carlo methods. Our results
give the maximum precision with which dimension-six operators can be
measured, or the maximal new physics reach of these
signatures. We then analyse how the differential information is
distributed over phase space, which defines optimal event
selections. In a next step, we calculate the information in individual
kinematic distributions, and compare it to the maximal information in
the full event kinematics. This provides a ranking of the most
powerful production and decay observables. It also allows us to
compare how much we can learn from a simple fit to histograms compared
to fully multivariate methods. Together, these tools can be used to
optimise measurement strategies.

This thesis begins with a synopsis of essential aspects of Higgs
physics and effective field theories in
\autoref{chapter:foundations}. In \autoref{chapter:validity}, we
discuss the validity of effective field theory for LHC measurements
and the matching between full models and effective
operators. \autoref{chapter:information} presents our work on
information geometry and optimal Higgs measurements. Both of these
chapters will contain separate and more detailed introductions and
conclusions. We summarise our results in
\autoref{chapter:conclusions}. In a set of appendices we list our
conventions, explain technical details, and provide additional
examples.
